The absolute magnitude is plotted as a function of the width of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ profile which indicates the maximum rotation velocity. Filled symbols represent galaxies for which independent distance estimates were obtained, either from RR Lyrae stars, Cepheids, or planetary nebulae. For galaxies represented by open symbols, the average distance of the respective group is used. The solid line is a fit to similar data for the Ursa-Major cluster, together with data of those galaxies for which individual distance estimates are available (filled symbols). The larger dispersion around the mean relation for the Sculptor group galaxies is due to the group’s extent along the line-of-sight. Source: M.J. Pierce \& R.B.
