\section{Cosmology}

\subsection{Preface}
Cosmology is the study of the Universe on the largest of scales -- the origin, evolution, and possible fate of the Universe as a whole. Cosmology concerns itself with asking questions such as: ``Where do we come from? What is the Universe made of? How did the elements form? Is it finite or infinite in spatial extent? Why is the Universe so smooth? How did galaxies form from such a smooth origin? Did the Universe have a beginning sometime in the past? Will it come to an end sometime in the future?'' As a branch of science that studies the entirety of the Universe, it often deals with distances that are very big, objects that are very large, and timescales that are very long. For this reason, standard units of distance (meters), mass (kilogram), and time (seconds or years) are far too small and therefore conventionally work in much larger standard units.

One distance measure often employed by astronomers is the \textbf{astronomical unit} (AU) which is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun over a period of one year: $1 {\rm AU} = 1.5 \times 10^{11}\,{\rm m}$. Such a distance scale is useful on the scale of the Solar System, but is small compared to the distance between stars. For interstellar distances, another unit of measure called the \textbf{parsec} (pc) is most useful which is defined to be the distance at which one AU subtends an angle of one arcsecond: $1\,{\rm pc} = 3.1\times10^{16}\,{\rm m}$. For example, we are located approximately $1.3\,{\rm pc}$ away from the nearest star, Proxima Centauri and $85\,{\rm pc}$ from the center of the Galaxy. This distance measure is therefore most useful for within the Galaxy but is small compared to the distance between neighbouring galaxies. For such intergalactic scales, units of megaparsecs (Mpc) are often used: $1\,{\rm Mpc} = 10^6\,{\rm pc} = 3.1\times10^{22}\,{\rm m}$. For example, we are located roughly $0.7\,{\rm Mpc}$ from the nearest galaxy Andromeda (M31), and $15\,{\rm Mpc}$ from the nearest cluster of galaxies, the Virgo cluster.

The standard unit of mass often used by astronomers is the Solar mass: $1\,{\rm M}_\odot = 2.0\times10^{30}\,{\rm kg}$. While the mass of the Galaxy isn't as well known as the Solar mass, it is approximately ${\rm M}_\mathrm{gal} \approx 10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Incidentally, the Sun also provides the standard unit of power (units of energy per second; Watts) in astronomy. The Sun's luminosity (i.e., the rate at which it radiates energy in the form of light) is $1\,{\rm L}_\odot = 3.8\times10^{26}\,{\rm W}$. The total luminosity of our Galaxy is ${\rm L}_\mathrm{gal} = 3.6\times10^{10}\,{\rm L}_\odot$.

Astronomers often measure timescales in years, the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun: $1\,{\rm yr} = 3.2\times10^7\,{\rm s}$. However since this is very short in terms of cosmological timescales, gigayears are more often employed: $1\,{\rm Gyr} = 10^9\,{\rm yr} = 3.2\times10^{16}\,{\rm s}$. 

While cosmology deals with very large measurements, it also deals with very small ones particularly in the early Universe when it was still hot and dense. This has introduced some terminology and units of particle physics to enter the realm of cosmology. For example, measurements of energy are sometimes given in units of \textbf{electron volts} (eV) instead of Joules: $1\,{\rm eV} = 1.6\times10^{-19}\,{\rm J}$. For example, the rest energy of the electron is $m_ec^2 = 511,000\,{\rm eV} = 0.51\,{\rm MeV}$ while the proton has a rest energy of $m_pc^2 = 938.3\,{\rm MeV}$.

A more universal, less culturally-biased system of units is the \textit{Planck system} based on the universal constants $G$, $c$, and $\hbar$. Combining the Newtonian gravitational constant, $G = 6.7\times10^{-11}\,{\rm m^3\,kg^{-1}\,s^{-2}}$, the speed of light, $c = 2.998\times10^8\,{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$, and the reduced Planck constant, $\hbar \equiv (h/2\pi) = 1.1\times10^{-34}\,{\rm J\,s} = 6.6\times10^{-16}\,{\rm eV\,s}$, yields a unique length scale known as the \textbf{Planck length}:

\begin{align*}
    \ell_P = \left( \frac{G}{\hbar c^3} \right)^{1/2} = 1.6\times10^{-35} ~ [{\rm m}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The same constants can be combined to form the \textbf{Planck mass},

\begin{align*}
    M_P \equiv \left( \frac{\hbar c}{G} \right)^{1/2} = 2.2\times10^{-8} ~ [{\rm kg}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and the \textbf{Planck time},

\begin{align*}
    t_P \equiv \left( \frac{G \hbar}{c^5} \right)^{1/2} = 5.4\times10^{-44} ~ [{\rm s}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Using Einstein's relation between mass and energy, we can also define the \textbf{Planck energy},

\begin{align*}
    E_P \equiv M_Pc^2 = 2.0\times10^9\,{\rm J} = 1.2\times10^{28} ~ [{\rm eV}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}By bringing the Boltzmann constant, $k_B = 8.6\times10^{-5}\, {\rm eV\,K^{-1}}$, into the act, we can also define the \textbf{Planck temperature},

\begin{align*}
    T_P = E_P/k_B = 1.4\times10^{32} ~ [{\rm K}].
\end{align*}

The current Standard Model for the Universe is the ``Hot Big Bang'' model, which states that the Universe has expanded from an initially hot and dense state to its current relatively cool and tenuous state, and that the expansion is still going on today. This Standard Model is based upon three observational pillars: (1) the Hubble diagram exhibiting expansion; (2) light element abundances which are in accord with Big Bang nucleosynthesis; and (3) the blackbody radiation left over from the first few hundred thousand years, the cosmic microwave background. Developments in the last two decades of the 20$^\mathrm{th}$ century -- both theoretical and observational-- point to several aspects that require an understanding beyond the Standard model: the existence of dark matter and perhaps even dark energy, the evolution of perturbations around the zero order smooth Universe, and inflation, the generator of these perturbations. The theory encompassing all these Beyond the Standard Model ingredients -- dark matter plus evolution of structure plus inflation -- is called Cold Dark Matter, or CDM. The ``Cold'' part of this moniker comes from requiring the dark matter particles to be able to clump efficiently in the early Universe. If they are hot instead, i.e., have large pressure, structure will not form at the appropriate levels.

Since temperature scales with redshift as $T=(1+z)T_0$, the very early Universe was hot and dense. As a result, interactions among particles occurred much more frequently than they do today. As an example, a photon today can travel across the observable Universe without deflection or capture, so it has a mean free path greater than $10^{28}\,{\rm cm}$. When the age of the Universe was equal to 1 second, though, the mean free path of a photon was about the size of an atom. Thus in the time it took the Universe to expand by a factor of 2, a given photon interacted many, many times. These multiple interactions kept the constituents in the Universe in equilibrium in most cases. Nonetheless, there were times when reactions could not proceed rapidly enough to maintain equilibrium conditions. These times are -- perhaps not coincidentally -- of the utmost interest to cosmologists today. This out-of-equilibrium phenomena played a role in (i) the formation of the light elements during Big Bang nucleosynthesis; (ii) recombination of electrons and protons into neutral hydrogen when the temperature was of order $1/4\,{\rm eV}$; and quite possibly in (iii) production of dark matter in the early Universe

% Inflation
\textbf{Inflation} was introduced partly to explain how regions which could not have been in causal contact with each other have the same temperature. It was soon realized that the very mechanism that explains the uniformity of the temperature in the Universe can also account for the origin of perturbations. Inflation predicts that quantum-mechanical perturbations in the very early Universe are first produced when the relevant scales are causally connected. Then these scales are whisked outside the horizon by inflation, only to reenter much later to serve as initial conditions for the growth of structure and anisotropy in the Universe. We are not actually sure that inflation is the mechanism that generated the initial perturbations as it is very difficult to test a theory based on energy scales well beyond the reach of particle accelerators. Nonetheless, it is by far the most plausible explanation and the next generation of CMB and large-scale structure observations will put inflation to some stringent tests. There is also no known scalar field which can drive inflation. Therefore, it may well be true that the idea of inflation is correct but it is driven by something other than a scalar field.

% BBN
As the temperature of the Universe cools to $1\,{\rm MeV}$, the cosmic plasma consists of (i) relativistic particles in equilibrium (i.e., photons, electrons and positrons), (ii) decoupled relativistic particles (i.e., neutrinos), and (iii) non-relativistic particles (i.e., baryons). The first simplification is that essentially no elements heavier than helium are produced at appreciable levels. So the only nuclei that need to be traced are hydrogen and helium, and their isotopes: deuterium, tritium, and $^3$He. The second simplification is that, even in the context of this reduced set of elements, the physics splits up neatly into two parts since above $T\sim\rm{MeV}$, no light nuclei form: only free protons and neutrons exist. The light elements in the Universe formed when the temperature of the cosmic plasma was of order $0.1\,{\rm MeV}$. During \textbf{Big Bang nucleosynthesis} (BBN) where the primordial chemical elements are formed in the early Universe, roughly a quarter of the mass of the baryons is in the form of $^4$He, the remaining in the form of free protons with only trace amounts of deuterium, $^3$He, and lithium.

% Recombination
As the temperature drops to $T\sim1\,{\rm eV}$, photons remain tightly coupled to electrons via Compton scattering and electrons to protons via Coulomb scattering. It will come as no surprise that at these temperatures, there is very little neutral hydrogen. Energetics of course favors the production of neutral hydrogen with a binding energy of $13.6\,{\rm eV}$, but the high photon/baryon ratio ensures that any hydrogen atom produced will be instantaneously ionized. These elements remain ionized until the temperature of the Universe drops well below the ionization energy of hydrogen. The \textbf{Epoch of Recombination} -- at which time electrons and protons combine to form neutral hydrogen -- is at redshift $z\sim1,100$ corresponding to a temperature $T\sim1,000\,{\rm K}$ (or $0.25\,{\rm eV}$). Before recombination, photons, electrons and protons are tightly coupled with one another because of Compton (the scattering of a photon by a charged particle, usually an electron) and Coulomb (elastic scattering of charged particles by the Coulomb interaction) scattering. After this time, photons travel freely through the Universe without interacting, so the photons in the CMB we observe today offer an excellent snapshot of the Universe at $z\sim1,100$. The importance of this snapshot cannot be overstated. Our understanding of structure is based upon the observation of small perturbations in the temperature maps of the CMB. These indicate that the early Universe was inhomogeneous at the level of $1$ part in $100,000$. Over time the action of gravity causes the growth of these small perturbations into larger non-linear structures, which collapse to form sheets, filaments, and halos. These non-linear structures provide the framework within which galaxies form via the collapse and cooling of gas until the density required for star formation is reached.

% Dark Ages
The cosmic \textbf{`Dark Ages'} is a period characterized by the absence of discrete sources of light via the first stars. The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts that nonlinear baryonic structure first emerges during this period, with virialized halos of dark and baryonic matter that span a range of masses from less than $10^4\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to about $10^8\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that are filled with neutral hydrogen atoms. The atomic density $n_\mathrm{H}$ and kinetic temperature of this gas $T_K$ are high enough that $T_K$ collisions populate the hyperfine levels of the ground state of these atoms in a ratio close to that of their statistical weights ($3$:$1$), with a spin temperature $T_S$ that greatly exceeds the excitation temperature $T_∗=0.0681\,{\rm K}$. Since, as we shall show, $T_S>T_\mathrm{CMB}$, the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as well, for the majority of the halos, these ``minihalos'' can be a detectable source of redshifted $21\,{\rm cm}$ line emission. In addition to learning about galaxies and reionization, $21\,{\rm cm}$ observations have the potential to inform us about fundamental physics too. Part of the signal traces the density field giving information about neutrino masses and the initial conditions from the early epoch of cosmic inflation in the form of the power spectrum.

% Epoch of Reionization (EoR)
The emergence of the first sources of light in the Universe and the subsequent \textbf{Epoch of Reionization} of hydrogen mark the end of the Dark Ages. Despite its remote timeline, this epoch is currently under intense theoretical investigation and is beginning to be probed observationally. There are various reasons why studying this epoch is important. The first reason is that the reionization of hydrogen is a global phase transition affecting the range of viable masses for galaxies. Before reionization, small galaxies will be shielded by neutral hydrogen from ionizing UV radiation and therefore will be able to form more easily. After reionization and the establishment of a UV background, the formation of very small galaxies is hampered. The second reason to study this epoch is that it makes it possible to probe the power spectrum of density fluctuations emerging from recombination at scales smaller than are accessible by current cosmic microwave background experiments. Finally, in a Universe where structures grow hierarchically, the first sources of light act as seeds for the subsequent formation of larger objects. Thus, the third reason to study this period is that by doing so we may learn about processes relevant to the formation of the nuclei of present-day giant galaxies and perhaps on the connection between the growth of black holes and evolution of their host galaxies. Direct detection of Population III objects and of the first galaxies will be very challenging and it will be attempted by future deep imaging survey using techniques now in use at lower redshift, like the Lyman-break technique. Individual Population III stars could be detected most easily as supernovae. Early objects may leave a signature in the backgrounds that could either be detected directly or through a fluctuation analysis; detecting this signature may be simpler than detecting individual objects. Polarization measurements with a microwave background experiment like WMAP enable us to constrain the Thomson optical depth which is essentially a density-weighted number of free electrons along the line of sight. We can also probe directly the presence of neutral hydrogen by using the Gunn-Peterson trough and the properties of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters. The Gunn–Peterson trough is essentially resonant Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption of the UV continuum of distant objects for wavelengths below that of Lyman-$\alpha$. While diffuse neutral hydrogen present within some redshift interval will scatter the continuum, local hydrogen can scatter line emission and provide a somewhat complementary test to the Gunn-Peterson test. Gunn-Peterson trough constraints from distant quasars indicate that hydrogen is reionized at $z<6$. Finally, a new promising area is that of $21\,{\rm cm}$ studies aiming at probing the distribution of neutral hydrogen at high redshift through detection of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line emission or, in the most ambitious cases, of $21\,{\rm cm}$ line absorption over the cosmic microwave background.

{\noindent}The Hubble constant of the Benchmark Model is assumed to be $H_0=70\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. The radiation in the Benchmark Model consists of photons and neutrinos. The photons are assumed to be provided solely by a CMB with current temperature $T_0=2.725\,{\rm K}$ and density parameter $\Omega_{\gamma,0}=5.0\times10^{-5}$. The energy density of the CNB is theoretically calculated to be 68\% of that of the CMB, as long as neutrinos are relativistic. The matter content of the Benchmark Model consists partly of baryonic matter (that is, matter composed of protons and neutrons, with associated electrons), and partly of nonbaryonic dark matter. The evidence indicates that most of the matter in the Universe is nonbaryonic dark matter. The baryonic material that we are familiar with from our everyday existence has a density parameter of $\Omega_{b,0}\approx0.04$ today. The density parameter of the nonbaryonic dark matter is roughly six times greater: $\Omega_{c,0}\approx0.26$. The bulk of the energy density in the Benchmark Model, however, is not provided by radiation or matter, but by a cosmological constant, with $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}=1-\Omega_{m,0}-\Omega_{r,0}\approx0.70$.

{\noindent}The Benchmark Model was first radiation-dominated, then matter-dominated, and is now entering into its lambda-dominated phase. Radiation gave way to matter at a scale factor $a_{rm}=\Omega{r,0}/\Omega{m,0}=2.8\times10^{-4}$, corresponding to a time $t_{rm}=4.7\times10^4\,{\rm yr}$. Matter, in turn, gave way to the cosmological constant at $a_{m\Lambda}=(\Omega_{m,0}/\Omega_{\Lambda,0})^{1/3}=0.75$, corresponding to $t_{m\Lambda}=9.8\,{\rm Gyr}$. The current age of the Universe, in the Benchmark Model, is $t_0=13.5\,{\rm Gyr}$.

{\noindent}With $\Omega_{r,0}$, $\Omega_{m,0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$ known, the scale factor $a(t)$ can be computed numerically using the Friedmann equation. The transition from the $a\propto t^{1/2}$ radiation-dominated phase to the $a\propto t^{2/3}$ matter-dominated phase is not an abrupt one; neither is the later transition from the matter-dominated phase to the exponentially growing lambda-dominated phase. One curious feature of the Benchmark Model is that we are living very close to the time of matter-lambda equality.

\subsection{Question 1}

What is recombination? At what temperature did it occur? Explain why this does not match the ionization potential of hydrogen.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Recombination\footnote{A complete misnomer as the plasma has always been completely ionized up to this point} refers to the time at which the temperature of the early Universe became cool enough such that it was thermodynamically favourable for the ionized plasma of free electrons and ions to couple and form neutral atoms. Numerically, this might be defined as the moment when the number density of ions is equal to the number density of neutral atoms. This occurred at a temperature of $T \sim 1,000\,{\rm K}$ (corresponding to an energy of $\sim 0.1\,{\rm eV}$) at a redshift of $z \sim 1,100$. This does not match the ionization potential of hydrogen because the early Universe (as it was hot and dense) can be described by a blackbody with a characteristic distribution of photon energies including an exponential tail of high energy photons (Wein's tail). While the peak of the blackbody spectrum describing the temperature of the early Universe is below the ionization energy of hydrogen, the photons in the high-energy exponential tail of the blackbody spectrum have sufficient energies for photoionization.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The term \textit{re}combination is a common misnomer because this was in fact the first time that free electrons combined with ions to produce a neutral medium -- some cosmologists hold that ``combination'' would have been a more appropriate term. Prior to this time, the mean free path of the photons against scattering off the free electrons is much less than the Hubble distance. This means that gravitational forces attempting to compress the plasma must also increase the photon density. This produces an increase in temperature and hence in radiation pressure. Any perturbation in the baryon-photon plasma thus behaves as an acoustic wave.

{\noindent}The ionization energy of hydrogen is $13.6\,{\rm eV}$. A photon $\gamma$ with an energy exceeding this ionization energy is capable of ionizing a hydrogen atom to produce a free electron $e$ and proton $p$ through the following process:

\begin{align*}
    {\rm H} + \gamma \rightarrow e + p.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This process can of course run in reverse through the process of \textit{radiative recombination} where a free electron and proton can combine to produce a bound neutral hydrogen atom:

\begin{align*}
    e + p \rightarrow {\rm H} + \gamma.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}A crude approximation for the temperature at which recombination occurred could be made by assuming that the average photon energy must have been at least the ionization energy of hydrogen. Since the current temperature of the CMB is $2.7\,{\rm K}$, this should yield a lower limit on the recombination temperature:

\begin{align*}
    T_\mathrm{rec} \sim \frac{E_\mathrm{ion}}{E_\mathrm{CMB}} = \frac{13.6\,{\rm eV}}{k_B \cdot 2.7\,{\rm K}} \sim 60,000 ~ [{\rm K}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Clearly this is a very crude estimate since this is off by an order or magnitude, the recombination temperature being closer to $T \sim 1,000\,{\rm K}$. This is because this doesn't take into consideration the fact that the CMB photon energies are not single-valued as assumed above. When a dense, opaque object is in thermal equilibrium (such as the early Universe), the distribution of photon energies only depends on temperature following the blackbody function (or Planck function): 

\begin{align}\label{eq:Planck}
    B_\nu(T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{\exp(h\nu/k_BT) - 1} ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}].
\end{align}

    \centering
    \caption{Blackbody spectra at various temperatures. Figure taken from Ryden (2017).}
    \label{fig:blackbody}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:blackbody} shows blackbody spectra for various temperatures in log-log space, where the peak of each blackbody spectrum is related to its associated temperature via $h\nu_\mathrm{peak} \approx 2.82\,k_BT$. While the mean photon energy is $2.82\,k_BT$, approximately one in ever 500 photons will have energies exceeding $10\,k_BT$, one in 3 million will exceed $20\,k_BT$, and one in 30 billion will exceed $30\,k_BT$. While only a small fraction of CMB photons are found in the high-energy tail-end of the Planck distribution, the overall number of CMB photons is enormous -- outnumbering baryons by nearly 2 billion to one. Therefore, the vast number of CMB photons surrounding neutral hydrogen atoms greatly increases the probability of photoionization, even with a mean photon energy less than the ionization energy of hydrogen.

\subsubsection{Follow-up Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How is the CMB related to recombination?
    \item Around how long ago or at what redshift did this occur?
    \item What is the last scattering surface?
    \item Is the surface of last scattering a well-defined surface (i.e., did recombination happen suddenly)?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 2}

The Universe is said to be ``flat," or, close to flat. What are the properties of a flat Universe and what evidence do we have for it?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

There are three simple properties of a flat Universe: (1) parallel lines never converge nor diverge; (2) the sum of all energy densities is equal to it's critical value; and (3) the sum of angles withing a triangle is always $180^\circ$. Two common techniques for measuring the curvature (i.e., topology) of the Universe include measuring the total energy density of the Universe ($\Omega_0$) and using the main peak in the CMB angular power spectrum as a standard ruler for the size of the sound horizon at the surface of last scattering.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

In developing a mathematical theory of general relativity, in which spacetime geometry/curvature is related to the mass-energy density, Einstein needed a way of mathematically describing curvature. Since picturing the curvature of a four-dimensional spacetime is, to say the least, difficult, let's start by considering ways of describing the curvature of two-dimensional spaces, then extend what we have learned to higher dimensions.

{\noindent}The simplest of two-dimensional spaces is a plane, on which Euclidean geometry holds (see (a) of Figure \ref{fig:geometries}). On a plane, a geodesic is a straight line. If a triangle is constructed on a plane by connecting three points with geodesics, the sum of the angles made with its vertices obeys:

\begin{align*}
    \Delta_\mathrm{flat} = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi ~~~~~[{\rm rad}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Note that a plane has infinite area, and has no upper limits on the possible distance between points.

{\noindent}Now consider another simple two-dimensional space, the surface of a sphere (see (b) of Figure \ref{fig:geometries}). On the surface of a sphere, a geodesic is a portion of a great circle -- that is, a circle whose center corresponds to the center of the sphere. If a triangle is constructed on the surface of the sphere by connecting three points with geodesics, the sum of the angles made with its vertices obeys:

\begin{align*}
    \Delta_\mathrm{closed} = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi + A/R^2 ~~~~~[{\rm rad}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $A$ is the area of the triangle, and $R$ is the radius of the sphere. All spaces in which $\alpha + \beta + \gamma > \pi$ are called ``positively curved'' spaces. The surface of a sphere is a positively curved two-dimensional space. Moreover, it is a space where the curvature is homogeneous and isotropic; no matter where you draw a triangle on the surface of a sphere, or how you orient it, it must always satisfy the above equation for $\Delta_\mathrm{closed}$. Note that a sphere has a maximum possible distance between points; the distance between antipodal points, at the maximum possible separation, is $\pi R$.

{\noindent}In addition to flat spaces and positively curved spaces, there exist negatively curved spaces. An example of a negatively curved two-dimensional space is the hyperboloid, or saddle-shape (see (c) of Figure \ref{fig:geometries}). If a triangle is constructed on this surface by connecting three points with geodesics, the sum of the angles made with its vertices obeys:

\begin{align*}
    \Delta_\mathrm{open} = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi - A/R^2 ~~~~~[{\rm rad}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $A$ is the area of the triangle, and $R$ is the radius of curvature. All spaces in which $\alpha + \beta + \gamma < \pi$ are called ``negatively curved'' spaces. The surface of a hyperboloid is a negatively curved two-dimensional space. A surface of constant negative curvature has infinite area, and has no upper limit on the possible distance between points.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={right,top},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{\\(a) Flat geometry for which $ \Delta_\mathrm{flat} = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$. (b) Closed geometry for which $\Delta_\mathrm{closed} = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi + A/R^2$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, and $R$ is the radius of the sphere. (c) Open geometry for which $\Delta_\mathrm{open} = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi - A/R^2$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, and $R$ is the radius of curvature.}}
    \label{fig:geometries}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/geometries.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}If you want a two-dimensional space to be homogeneous and isotropic, there are only three possibilities that fit the bill: the space can be uniformly flat, it can have uniform positive curvature, or it can have uniform negative curvature. Thus, if a two-dimensional space has curvature which is homogeneous and isotropic, its geometry can be specified by two quantities, $\kappa$, and $R$. The number $\kappa$, called the curvature constant, is $\kappa = 0$ for a flat space, $\kappa = +1$ for a positively curved space, and $\kappa = −1$ for a negatively curved space. If the space is curved, then the quantity $R$, which has dimensions of length, is the radius of curvature.

{\noindent}The results for two-dimensional space can be extended straightforwardly to three dimensions. A three-dimensional space, if its curvature is homogeneous and isotropic, must be flat, have uniform positive curvature, or have uniform negative curvature. If a three-dimensional space is flat ($\kappa = 0$), it has the following metric:

\begin{align*}
    ds^2_\mathrm{flat} = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}By making the simple coordinate substitution $x = r\cos\theta$, $y = r\sin\theta$, this can be written in spherical coordinates as:

\begin{align*}
    ds^2_\mathrm{flat} = dr^2 + r^2[d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If a three-dimensional space has uniform positive curvature ($\kappa = +1$), its metric is

\begin{align*}
    ds_\mathrm{closed}^2 = dr^2 + R^2\sin^2(r/R)[d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}A positively curved three-dimensional space has finite volume, just as a positively curved two-dimensional space has finite area. The point at $r = \pi R$ is the antipodal point to the origin, just as the south pole, at $r = \pi R$, is the antipodal point to the north pole, at $r = 0$, on the surface of a sphere. By traveling a distance $C = 2\pi R$, it is possible to ``circumnavigate'' a space of uniform positive curvature.

{\noindent}If a three-dimensional space has uniform negative curvature ($\kappa =
−1$), its metric is

\begin{align*}
    ds_\mathrm{open}^2 = dr^2 + R^2\sinh^2(r/R)[d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Like flat space, negatively curved space has infinite volume.

{\noindent}The three possible metrics for a homogeneous, isotropic, three-dimensional
space can be written more compactly in the form:

\begin{align*}
    ds^2 = dr^2 + S_\kappa(r)^2d\Omega^2
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where

\begin{align*}
    d\Omega \equiv d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and

\begin{equation*}
    S_\kappa(r) =
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    R\sin(r/R), ~~~~~& (\kappa = +1) \\
              r,~~~~~& (\kappa = 0) \\
    R\sinh(r/R),~~~~~& (\kappa = -1)
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
    .
\end{equation*}

{\noindent}Here, $\kappa=0,-1,+1$ is the sign of curvature for a flat, open, and closed Universe, respectively. The coordinate system ($r,\theta,\phi$) is not the only possible system. For instance, if we switch the radial coordinate from $r$ to $x \equiv S_\kappa(r)$, the metric for a homogeneous, isotropic, three-dimensional space can be written in the form:

\begin{align*}
    ds^2 = \frac{dx^2}{1-\kappa x^2/R^2} + x^2d\Omega^2.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}\textbf{Energy density of the Universe}: The \textbf{critical density} of the Universe is defined to be

\begin{align*}
    \rho_c \equiv \left( \frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G} \right) ~ [{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}which allows the density parameter to be defined as

\begin{align*}
    \Omega_0 \equiv \frac{\rho}{\rho_c} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If the total energy density is greater than the critical density (i.e., $\Omega_0>1$), then the Universe is said to be \textbf{closed}: initially parallel lines eventually converge, just as lines of constant longitude meet at the North and South poles. A closed Universe, much like the surface of a sphere, has positive curvature. In a low-density Universe whose total energy density is less than critical value (i.e., $\Omega_0<1$), the Universe is said to be \textbf{open}: initially parallel lines eventually diverge, as would marbles rolling off a saddle. While a closed Universe has positive curvature, an open Universe has negative curvature. 

{\noindent}\textbf{CMB angular power spectrum}: The comparison between the predicted acoustic peak scale and its angular extent provides a measurement of the angular diameter distance to recombination. The angular diameter distance in turn depends on the spatial curvature and expansion history of the Universe. Assuming the size of the Universe's horizon at the time of recombination and the distance to the last scattering surface, the geometry (or curvature) of the Universe can be measured using the angular size of the first peak of the angular power spectrum. If the first peak is at $\ell\sim220$, the Universe is flat, whereas if the first peak is at $\ell<220$ or $\ell>220$, the Universe is open or closed, respectively.

\subsection{Question 3}

Outline the development of the Cold Dark Matter spectrum of density fluctuations from the early Universe to the current epoch.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The primordial CDM spectrum is that of the scale-invariant Harrison-Zeldovich power spectrum (i.e., a flat power spectrum favouring neither large nor small scales). As the sound horizon grows, continuously larger modes are encompassed and become in causal contact which allows them to begin collapsing under their own self-gravity. The CDM power spectrum therefore begins to diverge from a flat spectrum at small modes which continues until the Universe turns over from being radiation-dominated to matter-dominated. At this point, the CDM power spectrum is frozen-in and there is a characteristic peak at $\sim250\,{\rm Mpc}$ which is defined by the sound horizon.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The generally accepted theoretical framework for the formation of structure is that of gravitational instability. The gravitational instability scenario assumes that the early Universe was almost perfectly smooth, with the exception of tiny density perturbations with respect to the global cosmic background density and the accompanying tiny velocity perturbations from the general Hubble expansion. The observed fluctuations in the CMB temperature are a reflection of these density perturbations, so we know that the primordial density perturbations must have been on the order of $\Delta T / T \sim 10^{-5}$. The origin of this density perturbation field has yet to be fully understood, but the most plausible theory currently is that they are a result of \textit{quantum fluctuations} which, during the inflationary phase, expanded to macroscopic scales.

{\noindent}Originally minute deviations from the average density of the Universe, and the corresponding deviations from the global cosmic expansion velocity (i.e., the Hubble expansion), will start to grow under the influence of gravity where the density perturbations will have induced local differences in gravity. During its early evolution, an overdensity will experience a gradually stronger deceleration of its expansion velocity such that its expansion velocity will continue to slow down with respect to the Hubble expansion. Since matter is gravitationally attracted to regions of higher density, it will also have the tendency to move towards that region. When the region has become sufficiently overdense, the mass of the density perturbation will have grown so much that its expansion would come to a halt. The region then completely decouples from the Hubble expansion and begins to collapse under its own gravity. The newly formed gravitationally bound object will reach virial equilibrium at which point it becomes a recognizable comic object; its precise nature (e.g., galaxy, cluster etc.) being determined by the properties of the initial density perturbation and its surroundings.

{\noindent}The opposite tendency will have occurred for underdensities in the matter density field. Since they contain less matter than the average density field, its expansion deceleration is less than the Hubble expansion which results in matter becoming even more dispersed and underdensities continuing to expand. As this process continues and becomes more pronounced, such underdensities result in the gradual emergence of voids in the matter distribution of the Universe. The most dramatic evidence for these spatial nonuniformities (i.e., overdensities and voids) on the largest of scales comes from redshift surveys such as the 2dF Galactic Redshift Survey\footnote{\href{http://www.2dfgrs.net/}{2dFGRS: http://www.2dfgrs.net/}} shown in Figure \ref{fig:2df}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:2df}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/2df.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Galaxies in Figure \ref{fig:2df} are clearly not distributed randomly: the Universe has structure on large scales. To understand this structure, we must go beyond the Standard Model not only by including dark matter, but also by allowing for deviations from smoothness. We must develop the tools to study perturbations around the smooth background of the Standard Model. This is straightforward in theory, as long as the perturbations remain small (i.e., linear). Indeed, understanding the development of structure in the Universe has become a major goal of most cosmologists today. Dark matter is needed not only to explain rotation curves of galaxies but to explain structure in the Universe at large!

{\noindent}The best ways to learn about the evolution of structure and to compare theory with observations are to look at anisotropies in the CMB and at how matter is distributed on large scales. Anisotropies in the CMB today tell us what the Universe looked like when it was several hundred thousand years old, so they are wonderful probes of the perturbations. To compare theory with observations, we must at first try to avoid scales dominated by nonlinearities. As an extreme example, we can never hope to understand cosmology by carefully examining rock formations on Earth. The intermediate steps -- collapse of matter into a galaxy; molecular cooling; star formation; planetary formation; etc. -- are much too complicated to allow comparison between linear theory and observations. While perturbations to matter on small scales (less than about $100\,{\rm Mpc}$) have grown nonlinear, large-scale perturbations are still small so they have been processed much less than the corresponding small-scale structure. Similarly, anisotropies in the CMB have remained small because the photons that make up the CMB do not clump.

{\noindent}Identifying large-scale structure and the CMB as the two most promising areas of study solves just one issue. Another very important challenge is to understand how to characterize these distributions so that theory can be compared to experiment. It is one thing to look at a map and quite another to quantitatively test cosmological models. To make such tests, it is often useful to take the Fourier transform of the distribution in question; as we will see, working in Fourier space makes it easier to separate large from small scales. The most important statistic in the cases of both the CMB and large-scale structure is the \textbf{two-point correlation function}, called the \textbf{power spectrum} in Fourier space.

{\noindent}If the mean density of galaxies at some time $t$ is $\langle\rho(t)\rangle$, then we can characterize the inhomogeneities with the dimensionless \textbf{density perturbation field} (also known as the \textbf{density contrast}) which is used to relate the energy density $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ at some co-moving spatial coordinate $\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$ to the average energy density at that time $\langle\rho(t)\rangle$:

\begin{align*}
    \delta(\mathbf{x},t) \equiv \frac{\rho(\mathbf{x},t)~- \langle\rho(t)\rangle}{\langle\rho(t)\rangle} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Evidently, in an unperturbed Universe with $\rho(\mathbf{x},t) = \langle\rho(t)\rangle$ everywhere, $\delta(\mathbf{x},t) = 0$. Note that positive density fluctuations (i.e., overdensities) may in principle grow limitless whereas negative density fluctuations (i.e., underdensities) have a strict lower-limit of $\delta \geq -1$ (emptier than empty simply doesn't exist). In a complete description of density perturbations, the total energy density of the Universe includes components of baryonic matter ($\rho_b$), cold dark matter ($\rho_c$), radiation ($\rho_\mathrm{rad}$), and dark energy ($\rho_\Lambda$):

\begin{align*}
    \rho(\mathbf{x},t) = \rho_b(\mathbf{x},t) + \rho_c(\mathbf{x},t) + \rho_\mathrm{rad}(\mathbf{x},t) + \rho_\Lambda(\mathbf{x},t) ~ [{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}In terms of their global gravitational influence, dark matter and baryonic matter contribute and evolve equivalently, therefore on cosmological scales they can be combined into a total matter energy density $\rho_m = \rho_b + \rho_c$. Each component may have its own (primordial) perturbation character. Dark energy does not have any density fluctuations, so $\delta_\Lambda(\mathbf{x},t) = 0$. Since most of the structure formation happened during the \textit{matter-dominated era}, this mainly involves the evolution of matter linear perturbations $\delta_m(\mathbf{x},t)$.

{\noindent}In addition to the density contrast, an alternative (and equivalent) description of the statistical properties of the matter distribution in the Universe is the \textbf{power spectrum} $P(k)$. Roughly speaking, the power spectrum describes the level of structure as a function of the length scale $L \simeq 2\pi/k$ where $k$ is a co-moving wavenumber. Phrased differently, the density fluctuations are decomposed into a set of plane waves of the form $\delta(\mathbf{x}) = \sum a_k\cos(\mathbf{x\cdot k})$ with wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ and amplitude $a_k$. The power spectrum $P(k)$ then describes the mean of the squares of the amplitudes $\lvert a_k \rvert^2$ averaged over all wave vectors with equal length $\lvert\mathbf{k}\rvert = k$. Technically speaking, this is a Fourier decomposition. The Fourier transform of $\delta(\mathbf{x},t)$ is $\tilde{\delta}(\mathbf{x},t)$, which allows the power spectrum $P(k)$ to be defined via

\begin{align*}
    \langle \tilde{\delta}(\mathbf{k}) \tilde{\delta}(\mathbf{k'}) \rangle = (2\pi)^3 P(k) \delta^3 (\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k'}) ~ [{\rm \mu K^2}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the angular brackets denote averaging over the entire distribution, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $\delta^3()$ is the delta Dirac function which constrains $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{k'}$. This indicates that the power spectrum is the spread, or the variance, in the distribution. Figure \ref{fig:galaxypowerspec} shows the combination $k^3P(k)/2\pi^2$, a dimensionless number which is a good indication of the clumpiness on scale $k$.

{\noindent}The power spectrum $P(k)$ and the two-point correlation function $\xi(x)$ are related through the Fourier transform as

\begin{align*}
    P(k) = 2\pi \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{\sin(kx)}{kx} x^2 \xi(x)\,{\rm d}x ~ [{\rm \mu K^2}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}i.e., the integral over the correlation function with a weight factor depending on the wave number provides the power spectrum. This relation can also be inverted to obtain the inverse Fourier transform such that the correlation function can be computed from the power spectrum. In general, knowing the power spectrum is insufficient to unambiguously describe the statistical properties of any density field; as such, the power spectrum is often used alongside the correlation function $\xi(x)$. Given observation data, either the power spectrum or the correlation function may be easier to compute, or another may be easier to obtain from models or simulations. In addition, our intuitive understanding of these functions may vary in different situations.

    \label{fig:cmbpowerspec}}
    {\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/cosmology/CMBPowerSpectrum.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The best measure of anisotropies in the CMB is also the two-point correlation function of the temperature distribution. There is a subtle technical difference between the two power spectra which are used to measure the galaxy distribution and the CMB, though. The difference arises because the CMB temperature is a two-dimensional field, measured everywhere on the sky (i.e., with two angular coordinates). Instead of Fourier transforming the CMB temperature, then, one typically expands it in spherical harmonics, a basis more appropriate for a 2D field on the surface of a sphere. Therefore the two-point correlation function of the CMB is a function of multipole moment $\ell$, not wave number $k$. Figure \ref{fig:cmbpowerspec} shows the measurements of dozens of groups since 1992, when COBE first discovered large-angle (low $\ell$ in the plot) anisotropies.

{\noindent}It is assumed that in very early epochs, the matter density field obeyed Gaussian statistics. This is a prediction of a large class of inflationary models which are supposed to generate the primordial density fluctuations of the Universe. An important property of Gaussian statistics, or \textit{Gaussian random fields}, is that their distributions are uniquely determined by their power spectrum $P(k)$. Among the properties which characterize these Gaussian random fields, the probability distribution of the density fluctuations $\delta(\mathbf{x})$ at any point is a Gaussian distribution. Observational evidence for the Gaussian nature of the early density fluctuations comes from observations of anisotropies in the CMB which very strongly constrain any possible deviation from a Gaussian random field in the early Universe.

{\noindent}The early linear stages of structure formation have been successfully and completely worked out within the context of \textit{linear perturbation theory}. For this discussion of the growth of density perturbations, we are concentrating on length scales that are substantially smaller than the Hubble radius. On such scales, structure growth can be described in the framework of the Newtonian theory of gravity; the effects of spacetime curvature and thus General Relativity need only be accounted for when density perturbations are on length scales comparable to, or larger than, the Hubble radius. In addition, we assume for simplicity that the matter in the Universe consists of only pressure-free matter described in the \textit{fluid approximation}.

{\noindent}Approximate solutions of the set of equations which describe small deviations from the homogeneous solution have the form

\begin{align*}
    \delta(\mathbf{x},t)=D(t)\tilde{\delta}(\mathbf{x}) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}i.e., the spatial and temporal dependencies factorize in these solutions. Here, $\tilde{\delta}(\mathbf{x})$ is an arbitrary function of the spatial coordinate, and D(t) satisfies the equation

\begin{align*}
    \ddot{D}(t)+\frac{2\dot{a}}{a}\dot{D}(t)-4\pi G\bar{\rho}(t)D(t) = 0 ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The differential equation has two linearly independent solutions. One can show that one of them increases with time, whereas the other decreases. If, at some early time, both functional dependencies were present, the increasing solution will dominate at later times, whereas the solution decreasing with $t$ will become irrelevant. Therefore, we will consider only the increasing solution, which is denoted by $D_+(t)$, and normalize it such that $D_+(t_0)=1$. Then, the density contrast becomes

\begin{align*}
    \delta(\mathbf{x},t) = D_+(t)\delta_0(\mathbf{x}) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This mathematical consideration allows us to draw immediately a number of conclusions. First, the solution implies that in linear perturbation theory the spatial shape of the density fluctuations is frozen in comoving coordinates, only their amplitude increases. The growth factor $D_+(t)$ of the amplitude follows a simple differential equation that is readily solvable for any cosmological model. In fact, one can show that for arbitrary values of the density parameters in matter and vacuum energy, the growth factor has the form

\begin{align*}
    D_+(t) \propto \frac{H(a)}{H_0}\int\limits_0^a \frac{da'}{[\Omega_m/a'+\Omega_\Lambda a'^2-(\Omega_m+\Omega_\Lambda-1)]^{3/2}},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the factor of proportionality is determined from the condition $D_+(t_0)=1$.

{\noindent}Primordial density perturbations on a small scale appear to have a much higher amplitude than those on larger scales. This leads to a hierarchical process of structure formation, with small-scale perturbations being the first one to become nonlinear and develop into cosmic objects.

{\noindent}Returning to the two-point correlation function and Fourier transform, $P(k)$ and $\xi(x)$ both depend on cosmological time or redshift because the density field in the Universe evolves over time. Therefore, the dependence on $t$ is explicitly written as $P(k,t)$ and $\xi(x,t)$. Note that $P(k,t)$ is linearly related to $\xi(x,t)$ and $\xi(x,t)$ in turn depends quadratically on the density contrast $\delta$. If $x$ is the comoving separation vector, we then know the time dependence of the density fluctuations, $\delta(x,t)=D_+(t)\delta_0(\mathbf{x})$. Thus,

\begin{align*}
    \xi(x,t) = D_+^2(t)\xi(x,t_0),
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and accordingly,

\begin{align*}
    P(k,t) = D_+^2(t)P(k,t_0) \equiv D_+^2(t)P_0(k)  ~ [{\rm \mu K^2}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}We stress that these relations are valid only in the framework of Newtonian, linear perturbation theory in the matter dominated era of the Universe. This last equation states that the knowledge of $P_0(k)$ is sufficient to obtain the power spectrum $P(k,t)$ at any time, again within the framework of linear perturbation theory.

{\noindent}Initially it may seem as if $P_0(k)$ is a function that can be chosen arbitrarily, but one objective of cosmology is to calculate this power spectrum and to compare it to observations. More than 30 years ago, arguments were already developed to specify the functional form of the initial power spectrum.

{\noindent}At early times, the expansion of the Universe follows a power law, $a(t)\propto t^{1/2}$ in the radiation-dominated era. At that time, no natural length-scale existed in the Universe to which one might compare a wavelength. The only mathematical function that depends on a length but does not contain any characteristic scale is a power law; hence for very early times one should expect

\begin{align*}
    P(k) \propto k^{n_s}  ~ [{\rm \mu K^2}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Many years ago, Harrison, Zeldovich, Peebles and others argued that $n_s=1$, as for this slope, the amplitude of the fluctuations of the gravitational potential are constant (i.e., preferring neither small nor large scales). For this reason, this spectrum with $n_s=1$ is called a scale-invariant spectrum, or Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum. With such a spectrum, we may choose a time $t_i$ after the inflationary epoch and write

\begin{align*}
    P(k,t_i) = D_+^2(t_i)Ak^{n_s} ~ [{\rm \mu K^2}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $A$ is a normalization constant that cannot be determined from theory but has to be fixed by observations. However, this is not the complete story: the result needs to be modified to account for the different growth of the amplitude of density fluctuations in the radiation-dominated epoch of the Universe, compared to that in the later cosmic epochs from which our result was derived.

{\noindent}Furthermore, these modifications depend on the nature of the dark matter. One distinguishes between cold dark matter (CDM) and hot dark matter (HDM). These two kinds of dark matter differ in the characteristic velocities of their constituents. Cold dark matter has a velocity dispersion that is negligible compared to astrophysically relevant velocities (e.g., the virial velocities of low-mass dark matter halos). Therefore, their initial velocity dispersion can well be approximated by zero, and all dark matter particles have the bulk velocity of the cosmic `fluid' (before the occurrence of multiple streams). In contrast, the velocity dispersion of hot dark matter is appreciable; neutrinos are the best candidates for HDM, in view of their known abundance, determined from the thermal history of the Universe, and their finite rest mass. The characteristic velocity of neutrinos is fully specified by their rest mass; despite their low temperature of $T_\nu=1.9\,{\rm K}$ today, their thermal velocities of

\begin{align*}
    v_\nu \sim 150(1+z)\left(\frac{m_\nu}{1\,{\rm eV}}\right)^{-1} ~ [{\rm km\,s^{-1}}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}prevent them from forming matter concentrations at all mass scales except for the most massive ones, as their velocity is larger than the corresponding escape velocities. In other words, the finite velocity dispersion of HDM is equivalent to assigning to it a pressure, which prevents them to fall into shallow gravitational potential wells. We will see below the dramatic differences between these two kinds of dark matter for the formation of structures in the Universe. In particular, this estimate shows that neutrinos cannot account for the dark matter on galaxy scales, and thus cannot explain the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies.

{\noindent}If density fluctuations become too large on a certain scale, linear perturbation theory breaks down and the linear approximation to the solution of $P(k,t)$ is no longer valid. Then the true current-day power spectrum $P(k,t_0)$ will deviate from $P_0(t)$. Nevertheless, in this case it is still useful to examine $P_0(t)$ -- it is then called the linearly extrapolated power spectrum.

{\noindent}Within the framework of linear Newtonian perturbation theory in the `cosmic fluid', $\delta(\mathbf{x},t) = D_+(t)\delta(\mathbf{x})$ applies. Modifications to this behavior are necessary for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If dark matter consists (partly) of HDM, this may not be gravitationally bound to the potential well of a density concentration. In this case, the particles are able to move freely and to escape from the potential well, which in the end leads to its dissolution if these particles dominate the matter overdensity. From this argument, it follows immediately that for HDM, small-scale density perturbations cannot form. For CDM this effect of free streaming does not occur.
    \item At redshifts $z\gtrsim z_\mathrm{eq}$, radiation dominates the density of the Universe. Since the expansion law $a(t)$ is then distinctly different from that in the matter-dominated phase, the growth rate for density fluctuations will also change.
    \item A cosmic horizon exists with comoving scale $r_\mathrm{H,com}(t)$. Physical interactions can take place only on scales smaller than $r_\mathrm{H,com}(t)$. For fluctuations of length-scales $L\sim2\pi/k\gtrsim r_\mathrm{H,com}(t)$, Newtonian perturbation theory will cease to be valid, and one needs to apply linear perturbation theory in the framework of the General Relativity.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}These effects together will lead to a modification of the shape of the power spectrum, relative to the relation $P(k,t_i)=D_+^2(t_i)Ak^{n_s}$; for example, the evolution of perturbations in the radiation-dominated cosmos proceeds differently from that in the matter-dominated era. The power spectrum $P(k)$ is affected by the combination of the above effects, and will be different from the primordial spectral shape, $P\propto k^{n_s}$. The modification of the power spectrum is described in terms of the transfer function $T(k)$ in the form

\begin{align*}
    P(k,t) = D_+^2(t) Ak^{n_s}T^2(k)  ~ [{\rm \mu K^2}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The transfer function can be computed for any cosmological model if the matter content of the Universe is specified. In particular, $T(k)$ depends on the nature of dark matter.

{\noindent}The first of the above points immediately implies that a clear difference must exist between HDM and CDM models regarding structure formation and evolution. In HDM models, small-scale fluctuations are washed out by free-streaming of relativistic particles (i.e., the power spectrum is completely suppressed for large $k$, which is expressed by the transfer function $T(k)$ decreasing exponentially for large $k$). In the context of such a theory, very large structures will form first, and galaxies can form only later by fragmentation of large structures. However, this formation scenario is in clear contradiction with observations. For example, we observe galaxies and QSOs at $z>6$ so that small-scale structure is already present at times when the Universe had less than 10\% of its current age. In addition, the observed correlation function of galaxies, both in the local Universe (see Figure \ref{fig:densitycontrast}) and at higher redshift, is incompatible with cosmological models in which the dark matter is composed mainly of HDM. Therefore we can exclude HDM as the dominant constituent of dark matter. For this reason, it is now commonly assumed that the dark matter is ‘cold’. The achievements of the CDM scenario in the comparison between model predictions and observations fully justify this assumption.

{\noindent}In linear perturbation theory, fluctuations grow at the same rate on all scales, or for all wave numbers, independent of each other. This applies not only in the Newtonian case, but also remains valid in the framework of General Relativity as long as the fluctuation amplitudes are small. Therefore, the behavior on any (comoving) length-scale can be investigated independently of the other scales. At very early times, perturbations with a comoving scale $L$ are larger than the (comoving) horizon, and only for $z<z_\mathrm{enter}(L)$ does the horizon become larger than the considered scale $L$. Here, $z_\mathrm{enter}(L)$ is defined as the redshift at which the (comoving) horizon equals the (comoving) length-scale $L$,

\begin{align*}
    r_\mathrm{H,com}(z_\mathrm{enter}(L)) = L ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}It is common to say that at $z_\mathrm{enter}(L)$ the perturbation under consideration `enters the horizon', whereas actually the process is the opposite -- the horizon outgrows the perturbation. Relativistic perturbation theory shows that density fluctuations of scale $L$ grow as long as $L>r_\mathrm{H,com}$, namely $\propto a^2$ if radiation dominates (thus, for $z>z_\mathrm{rm}$), or $\propto a$ if matter dominates (i.e., for $z<z_\mathrm{rm}$). Free-streaming particles or pressure gradients cannot impede the growth on scales larger than the horizon length because, according to the definition of the horizon, physical interactions (which pressure or free-streaming particles would be) cannot extend to scales larger than the horizon size.

{\noindent}The evolution of density fluctuations of baryons differs from that of DM. The reason for this is essentially the interaction of baryons with photons: although matter dominates the Universe for $z<z_\mathrm{rm}$, the energy density of baryons remains smaller than that of the photons for a longer time after recombination begins, as can be seen as follows: the baryon-to-photon density ratio is

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\rho_b}{\rho_\gamma} = \frac{\Omega_ba^{-3}}{\Omega_\gamma a^{-4}} = a\frac{\Omega_b\Omega_m\Omega_r}{\Omega_m\Omega_r\Omega_\gamma} = 1.68\frac{a}{a_\mathrm{rm}}\frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_m} \sim 0.28\frac{a}{a_\mathrm{rm}} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Hence, if radiation-matter equality happens at $z_\mathrm{rm}\sim3,000$, then the photon density is larger than that of the baryons for $z\gtrsim800$.

{\noindent}Since photons and baryons interact with each other by photon scattering on free electrons, which again are tightly coupled electromagnetically to protons and helium nuclei, baryons and photons are strongly coupled before recombination, and form a single fluid. Due to the presence of photons, this fluid has a strong pressure, which prevents it from falling into potential wells formed by the dark matter. Thus, the pressure prevents strong inhomogeneities of the baryon-photon fluid.

{\noindent}To discuss the evolution of baryon perturbations in a bit more detail, we consider again a perturbation of comoving scale $L$. As long as the perturbation is larger than the horizon size, pressure effects can not affect the behavior of the fluid, and thus baryons and photons behave in the same way as the dark matter -- the amplitude of their perturbations grow. As soon as the perturbation enters the horizon, the situation changes. Although the baryons are gravitationally pulled into the density maxima of the dark matter, pressure provides a restoring force which acts against a compression of the baryon-photon fluid. As a results, this fluid will develop sound waves.

{\noindent}The maximum distance sound waves can
travel up to a given epoch is called the sound horizon.
Loosely speaking, it is given by the product of the sound
speed and the cosmic time. The sound speed in this photon-dominated fluid is given by $c_s\approx c/\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the sound horizon is about a factor of $\sqrt{3}$ smaller than the event horizon. As soon as a perturbation enters the sound horizon, the amplitude of the baryon-photon fluctuations can not grow anymore; instead, the undergo damped oscillations.

{\noindent}The adiabatic sound speed $c_s$ of a fluid is given in general by

\begin{align*}
    c_s = \sqrt{\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}} ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The pressure of the fluid is generated by the photons, $P=c^2\rho_\gamma/3=c^2\rho_c\Omega_\gamma$, and the density is the sum of that of baryons and photons, $\rho=(\Omega_ba^{-3}+\Omega_\gamma a^{-4})\rho_c$. Thus, the sound velocity is

\begin{align*}
    c_s &= \sqrt{\frac{\partial P}{\partial\rho}} \\
        &= \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}a}{\mathrm{d}\rho/\mathrm{d}a}} \\
        &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{\frac{4\Omega_\gamma a^{-5}}{3\Omega_ba^{-4}+4\Omega_\gamma a^{-5}}} \\
        &= \frac{c}{\sqrt{3(1+\mathcal{R})}} ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\mathcal{R}$ is defined to be

\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{R} = \frac{3}{4}\frac{\rho_b}{\rho_\gamma} = \frac{3}{4}\frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_\gamma}a ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Note that $\mathcal{R}$ is smaller than unity until recombination, and thus $c_s\approx c/\sqrt{3}$ provides a reasonable first approximation.

{\noindent}At recombination, the free electrons recombined with the hydrogen and helium nuclei, after which there are essentially no more free electrons which couple to the photon field. Hence, after recombination the baryon fluid lacks the pressure support of the photons, and the sound speed drops to zero -- the sound waves do no longer propagate, but get frozen in. Now the baryons are free to react to the gravitational field created by the dark matter inhomogeneities, and they can fall into their potential wells. After some time, the spatial distribution of the baryons is essentially the same as that of the dark matter.

{\noindent}Hence, there is a maximum wavelength of the sound waves, namely the (comoving) sound horizon at recombination,

\begin{align*}
    r_\mathrm{H,com}(z) &= \int\limits_0^t \frac{c\mathrm{d}t}{a(t)} \\ 
    &= \int\limits_0^{(1+z)^{-1}} \frac{c\mathrm{d}a}{a^2H(a)} \\
    &= \int\limits_0^{a_\mathrm{rec}} \frac{c\mathrm{d}a}{\sqrt{3(1+\mathcal{R})}a^2H(a)} ~ [{\rm Mpc}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where we exchanged the speed of light by the speed of sound.

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:perturbationevolution} illustrates the physical significance of this length scale, showing the time evolution of an initial density peak of all four components in the Universe. The length scale $r_s$ is the distance the baryon-photon fluid propagates outwards from the initial density peak before baryons and photons decouple, after which the density perturbation of baryons gets frozen. The x-axis shows the comoving radial coordinate, the y-axis displays the density, multiplied by (radius)$^2$. The different snapshots show the spatial distribution of the various species at later epochs. In particular, because the region is overdense in photons, it is overpressured relative to its surroundings. This overpressure must equilibrate by driving a spherical sound wave out into the baryon-photon plasma which propagates at the speed of sound, $c_s\approx c/\sqrt{3}$. Neutrinos freely stream out of the perturbation at the speed of light. The photon and baryons are strongly coupled before recombination, and thus have the same spatial distribution. At the time of decoupling, the wave stalls as the pressure supplying the photons escape and the sound speed plummets. One ends up with a CDM overdensity at the center and a baryon overdensity in a spherical shell $150$ comoving megaparsecs in radius for the concordance cosmology. At $z\ll10^3$, both of these overdensities attract gas and CDM to them, seeding the usual gravitational instability. However, some of the matter also falls into the density peaks (in the example of this figure, it is an overdense spherical shell) created by baryons, whereas the density profile of neutrinos and photons becomes flat. At late times, the distributions of baryons and dark matter become identical (before the onset of non-linear processes such as halo formation). The central density peak, and the secondary peak have a well-defined separation, given by the distance a sound wave could travel before the baryons decoupled from the photons. Galaxies are more likely to form in these overdensities. The radius of the sphere marks a preferred separation of galaxies, which we quantify as a peak in the correlation function on this scale.

{\noindent}The Universe is of course a superposition of these point-like perturbations, but as the perturbation theory is exquisitely linear at high redshift, we can simply add the solutions. The width of the acoustic peak is set by three factors: silk damping due to photons leaking out of the sound wave, adiabatic broadening of the wave as the sound speed changes because of the increasing inertia of the baryons relative to the photons, and the correlations of the initial perturbations.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}There are some other interesting aspects of the physics of this epoch that are worth mentioning. First is that the outgoing wave does not actually stop at $z\sim10^3$ but instead slows around $z\sim500$. This is partially due to the fact that decoupling is not coincident with recombination but is also because the coupling to the growing mode is actually dominated by the velocity field, rather than the density field, at $z\sim10^3$. In other words, the compressing velocity field in front of the wave actually keys the instability at a later time.

{\noindent}Two other aspects that may be surprising at first
glance are that the outgoing pulse of neutrino overdensity does not actually remain as a delta function, as one might expect for a population traveling radially outward at the speed of light, and that the CDM perturbation does not remain at the origin, as one would expect for a cold species. Both of these effects are due to a hidden assumption in the initial conditions: although the density field is homogeneous everywhere but the origin, the velocity field cannot be for a growing mode. To keep the bulk of the Universe homogeneous while growing a perturbation at the origin, matter
must be accelerating toward the center; this acceleration is supplied by the gravitational force from the central overdensity. However, in the radiation-dominated epoch the outward-going pulse of neutrinos and photons is carrying away most of the energy density of the central perturbation. This outward-going pulse decreases the acceleration, causing the inward flow of the homogeneous bulk to deviate from the divergenceless flow and generating the behavior of the CDM and neutrinos mentioned above. Essentially,
the outgoing shells of neutrinos and photons raise a wake in the homogeneous distribution of CDM away from the origin
of the perturbation.

{\noindent}The smoothing of the CDM overdensity from a delta function at the origin is the famous small-scale damping of the CDM power spectrum in the radiation-dominated epoch. The overdensity raised decreases as a function of radius because the radiation is decreasing in energy density relative to the inertia of the CDM; in the matter-dominated regime, the outward-going radiation has no further effect. A Universe with more radiation causes a larger effect that extends to larger radii; this corresponds to the shift in the CDM power spectrum with the matter-to-radiation ratio.

{\noindent}Returning to the major conceptual point, that of the shell of overdensity left at the sound horizon, we see immediately that the sound horizon provides a standard ruler. The radius of the shell depends simply on the sound speed and the amount of propagation time. The sound speed is set by the balance of radiation pressure and inertia from the baryons; this is controlled simply by the baryon-to-photon ratio, which is $\Omega_bh^2$. The propagation time depends on the expansion rate in the matter-dominated and radiation-dominated regimes; this in turn depends on the redshift of matter-radiation equality, which depends only on $\Omega_mh^2$ for the standard assumption of the radiation density (i.e., the standard cosmic neutrino and photon backgrounds and nothing else).

{\noindent}The sound waves in the baryon-photon fluid, the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs), are observable today. Since at recombination, the photons interacted with matter for the last time, the CMB radiation provides us with a picture of the density fluctuations at the epoch of recombination. Our observable cosmic microwave sky essentially is a picture of a two-dimensional cut at fixed time (the time of last scattering) through the density field of the baryons. A cut through an ensemble of sound waves shows an instantaneous picture of these waves. Hence, they are expected to be visible in the temperature distribution of the CMB. This is indeed the case: these BAOs imprint one of the most characteristic features on the CMB anisotropies. Since the sound waves are damped once they are inside the sound horizon, the largest amplitude waves are those whose wavelength equals the sound horizon at recombination.

{\noindent}We have argued that the baryons, once they are no longer coupled to radiation and thus become pressureless, fall into the potential wells of the dark matter. This happens because the dark matter fluctuations can grow while the baryonic fluctuations could not due to the photon pressure, and because the mean density of dark matter is substantially larger than that of the baryons. This is almost the full story, but not entirely: baryons make about 15\% of the total matter density, and are therefore not negligible. After recombination, the BAOs are frozen, like standing waves, and thus the total matter fluctuations are a superposition of the dark matter inhomogeneities and these standing waves. Whereas the dark matter dominates the density fluctuations, a small fraction of the matter also follows the inhomogeneities created by the standing waves. Since these waves have a characteristic length scale (the sound horizon at recombination) this characteristic length scale should be visible in the properties of the matter distribution even today. The correlation function of galaxies contains a characteristic feature at the length scale $r_s$. Hence, relics of the sound waves in the pre-recombination era are even visible in the current Universe. The effects of the BAOs are included in the transfer function $T(k)$, which thus shows some low-amplitude oscillations, often called `wiggles'.

{\noindent}The distance that acoustic waves can propagate in the first million years of the Universe is measurable not only in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies but also in the late-time clustering of galaxies.

\subsection{Question 4}

State and explain three key pieces of evidence for a Big Bang origin for the observable Universe.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The success of the Big Bang (BB) rests on three observational pillars:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Hubble's Law exhibiting expansion: The first key observation to the modern era of cosmology that the Universe is expanding. If the Universe is expanding at the present time, then by `turning back the clock' the Universe must have been much smaller in the past. Hence, the BB.
    \item Light element abundances which are in accord with Big Bang nucleosynthesis: When the Universe was still a very hot plasma, the extreme radiation field ensured that any nucleus produced would be immediately photoionized by a high energy photon. As the Universe cooled (via expansion) well below the typical binding energies of nuclei, light elements began to form. Knowing the conditions of the early Universe and the relevant cross sections, one can calculate the expected primordial abundances of these light elements. Such predictions are consistent with measurements.
    \item The blackbody radiation left over from the first few hundred thousand years, the cosmic microwave background: The fact that the early Universe was very hot and dense meant that the baryonic matter was well coupled with the radiation field implying thermal equilibrium (TE) of photons. In TE, photons should follow the blackbody (or Planck) function in which the energy density is only dependent on temperature. As it turns out, the CMB radiation is the most accurate BB curve yet to be measured!
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

1. \textbf{Hubble's Law}

{\noindent}We have good evidence that the Universe is expanding. This means that early in its history, the distances between galaxies was smaller than it is today. It's convenient to describe this expansion effect by introducing the \textbf{scale factor} $a$, whose present value is equal to one ($a(t_0)\equiv1$). At earlier times, $a$ was much smaller than it is today -- hence, the Big Bang. 

{\noindent}The first key observation to the modern era of cosmology was the discovery of an expanding Universe. This is popularly credited to Edwin Hubble in 1929, but in fact the honour lies with Vesto Slipher more than 10 years earlier. Slipher was measuring spectra of nebulae whose nature was still under hot debate at that time. Observations of Hubble settled this debate in 1924 when he discovered \textit{Cepheid variables} in M31 (Andromeda) establishing a distance of roughly $1\,{\rm Mpc}$. More than a decade earlier in 1913, Slipher had measured the spectrum of M31 and found that it was approaching Earth at a velocity of over $200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. Over the next decade, he measured Doppler shifts for dozens of galaxies: with only a few exceptions, they were redshifted. By the time Hubble arrived, the basics of relativistic cosmology were already worked out and predictions existed that galaxy redshifts should increase with distance. It's hard to know how much these influenced Hubble, but by 1929 he had obtained Cepheid distances towards 24 galaxies along with their redshifts and claimed that they followed the empirical linear relationship:

\begin{align*}
    v = H_0 d ~ [{\rm km\,s^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}citing theoretical predictions as a possible explanation. At the time, Hubble estimated $H_0 \approx 500\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ because his calibration of Cepheid variables was in error. The best modern value is currently $H_0 = 70\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$.

    \label{fig:hubblediagram}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/HubbleDiagram.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Recall that the wavelength of light or sound emitted from a receding object is stretched out (i.e., Doppler shifted) so that the observed wavelength is larger than the emitted one. It is convenient to define this stretching factor as the redshift $z$:

\begin{align*}
    1+z \equiv \frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{a} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}or

\begin{align*}
    (1+z)^{-1} \equiv \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0} = a ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}For low redshifts, the standard Doppler formula applies and $z \sim v/c$. Therefore, a measurement of the amount by which absorption and/or emission lines are redshifted is a direct measure of how fast the structures in which they reside are receding from us. Hubble's diagram is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hubblediagram}, which shows not only that distant galaxies appear to be receding from us, but that the trend increases linearly with distance which is exactly what we would expect for an expanding Universe.

{\noindent}The Hubble diagram is still the most direct evidence we have that the Universe is expanding. Current incarnations use the same principle as the original: find the distance and the redshift of distant objects. Measuring redshifts is straightforward; the hard part is determining distances for objects of unknown intrinsic brightness. One of the most popular techniques is to try to find a standard candle, a class of objects which have the same intrinsic brightness. Any difference between the apparent brightness of two such objects then is a result of their different distances from us. This method is typically generalized to find a correlation between an observable and intrinsic brightness. For example, \textbf{Cepheid variables} are stars for which intrinsic brightness is tightly related to their pulsation period.

    \label{fig:hubblediagram_modern}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/HubbleDiagram_modern.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}As seen in Figure \ref{fig:hubblediagram_modern}, the standard candle that can be seen at largest distances is a Type la supernova. Since they are so bright, supernovae can be used to extend the Hubble diagram out to very large redshifts (the current record is of order $z\sim1.7$), a regime where the simple Doppler law ceases to work. Figure \ref{fig:hubblediagram_modern} shows a recent Hubble diagram using these very distant objects. The three curves in Figure \ref{fig:hubblediagram_modern} depict three different possibilities: flat matter dominated; open; and flat with a cosmological constant ($\Omega$). The high-redshift data are now good enough to distinguish among these possibilities, strongly disfavoring the previously favored flat, matter-dominated Universe. The current best fit is a Universe with about 70\% of the energy in the form of a cosmological constant, or some other form of dark energy.

{\noindent}2. \textbf{Big Bang Nucleosynthesis}

{\noindent}When the Universe was much hotter and denser, when the temperature was of order an ${\rm MeV/k_B}$, there were no neutral atoms or even bound nuclei. The vast amounts of radiation in such a hot environment ensured that any atom or nucleus produced would be immediately destroyed by a high energy photon. As the Universe cooled well below the binding energies of typical nuclei, light elements began to form. Knowing the conditions of the early Universe and the relevant nuclear cross-sections, we can calculate the expected primordial abundances of all the elements.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={left,center},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{BBN predictions of the primordial abundances of light elements as a function of today’s baryon density ($\rho_{b,0}$ lower axis) and the corresponding density parameter $\Omega_b$ where $h=0.65$ was assumed.

The horizontal extent results from the overlap of these intervals with curves computed from theoretical models. The ranges in $\Omega_b$ that are allowed by these three species do overlap, as is indicated by the vertical strip. The deuterium measurements yield the most stringent constraints for $\Omega_b$. Figure taken from Schneider (2006).}}
    \label{fig:bbn_prediction}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/BBN_prediction.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:bbn_prediction} shows the predictions of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) for the light element abundances\footnote{Recall nuclear notation: The 4 in $^4$He refers to the total number of nucleons (protons and neutrons). So $^4$He has two neutrons and two protons, while $^3$He has two protons and one neutron.}. The boxes and arrows show the current estimates for the light element abundances. These are consistent with the predictions, and this consistency test provides yet another ringing confirmation of the Big Bang. The theoretical predictions depend on the density of protons and neutrons at the time of nucleosynthesis. The combined proton plus neutron density is called the \textbf{baryon density} ($\rho_b$) since both protons and neutrons have baryon number one and these are the only baryons around at the time. Thus, BBN gives us a way of measuring the baryon density in the Universe. Since we know how those densities scale as the Universe evolves (they fall as $a^{-3}$), we can turn the measurements of light element abundances into measures of the baryon density today.

{\noindent}In particular, the measurement of primordial deuterium pins down the baryon density extremely accurately to only a few percent of the critical density. Ordinary matter (baryons) contributes at most 5\% of the critical density (i.e., $\Omega_b = 0.005$). Since the total matter density today is almost certainly larger than this -- direct estimates give values of order 20-30\% — nucleosynthesis provides a compelling argument for non-baryonic dark matter.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={left,center},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{Spectrum from a distant QSO (Buries, Nollett, and Turner, 1999).

    \label{fig:deuterium}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/deuterium.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The deuterium measurements (Buries \& Tytler, 1998) are the new developments in the field. These measurements are so exciting because they explore the deuterium abundance at redshifts of order 3-4, well before much processing could have altered the primordial abundances. Figure \ref{fig:deuterium} shows one such detection. The basic idea is that light from distant QSOs is absorbed by intervening neutral hydrogen systems. The key absorption feature arises from transition from the ground state (n=1) of hydrogen to the first excited state (n = 2), requiring a photon with wavelength $\lambda = 1215.7$ \AA. Since photons are absorbed when exciting hydrogen in this fashion, there is a trough in the spectrum at {\AA}, redshifted by a factor of $(1+z)$. The corresponding line from deuterium should be (i) shifted over by $0.33(1+z)$ {\AA} and (ii) much less damped since there is much less deuterium. Figure \ref{fig:deuterium} shows just such a system; there are now half a dozen with detections precisely in the neighborhood shown in Figure \ref{fig:bbn_prediction}. Note that the steep decline in deuterium as a function of baryon density helps here: even relatively large errors in deuterium measurements translate into small errors on the baryon density.

{\noindent}3. \textbf{Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)}

{\noindent}The CMB offers us a look at the Universe when it was only $\sim 380,000$ years old. The photons in the CMB last scattered off electrons at $z \sim 1100$; since then they have traveled freely through space. When we observe them today, they literally come from the earliest moments of time. They are therefore the most powerful probes of the early Universe. If an object is opaque then the protons, neutrons, electrons, and photons which it contains frequently interact and attain \textit{thermal equilibrium}. A crucial fact about the CMB is that the collisions between electrons and photons before last scattering ensured that the photons were in equilibrium. That is, they should have a blackbody spectrum. When a system is in thermal equilibrium, the density of photons in the system as a function of photon energy depends only on the system temperature $T$. It doesn't matter whether the system is a tungsten filament or a sphere of ionized hydrogen and helium.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={right,center},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{Intensity of cosmic microwave radiation as a function of wavenumber from Far InfraRed Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) (Mather et al., 1994), an instrument on the COBE satellite. Hidden in the theoretical blackbody curve are dozens of measured points, all of which have uncertainties smaller than the thickness of the curve! Figure taken from Dodelson (2003).}}
    \label{fig:cmb_cobe}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/CMB_COBE.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The specific intensity of a gas of photons following a blackbody spectrum is called the \textbf{Planck function}:

\begin{align*}
    I_\nu = B_\nu(T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{\exp({h\nu/k_BT}) - 1} ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:cmb_cobe} shows the remarkable agreement between this prediction of Big Bang cosmology and the observations by the FIRAS instrument aboard the COBE spacecraft. We have been told that detection of the $3\,{\rm K}$ background by Penzias and Wilson in the mid-1960s was sufficient evidence to decide the controversy in favor of the Big Bang over the Steady State Universe. Penzias and Wilson, though, measured the radiation at just one wavelength. If even their one-wavelength result was enough to tip the scales, the current data depicted in Figure \ref{fig:cmb_cobe} should send skeptics from the pages of physics journals to the far reaches of radical Internet chat groups.

{\noindent}The photons which make up the cosmic microwave background (CMB) today have a well-measured temperature $T_\mathrm{CMB} = 2.725 \pm 0.002\,{\rm K}$. A photon with an energy $k_BT_\mathrm{CMB}$ today has a wavelength $hc/k_BT_\mathrm{CMB}$. Early on, when the scale factor was smaller than it is today, this wavelength would have been correspondingly smaller. Since the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, the photon energy would have been larger than today by a factor of $1/a$. This argument applied to the thermal bath of photons implies that the temperature of the plasma as a function of time is

\begin{align*}
    T(t) = \frac{T_0}{a(t)} = T_0(1+z) ~ [{\rm K}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}At early times, then, the temperature was higher than it is today.

{\noindent}The energy density of each component of the Universe is equal to the number density of each corresponding component times its average energy. The primary energy density components of the Universe includes radiation, matter (baryons and dark matter), and dark energy. Since photon energy scales as $a^{-1}$ in addition to the number density which scales as $a^{-3}$, the energy density of radiation should scale as $a^{-4}$. The energy density of non-relativistic particles, such as baryons, have a constant rest mass energy. Since their number density scales inversely proportional to volume, the energy density of matter scales as $a^{-3}$. Dark energy (introduced as a cosmological constant) is believed to have a constant energy density. While matter, and possibly a cosmological constant, dominate the current cosmological landscape, radiation must have been the dominant constituent of the Universe due to its energy density scaling of $a^{-4}$. Figure \ref{fig:energydensityscaling} illustrates how radiation, matter, and the cosmological constant energy density components evolve with time.

{\noindent}The CMB was detected by Arno Penzias \& Robert Wilson in 1965 and were awarded the 1978 Nobel prize in physics; they accomplished this by locating an unaccounted-for source of noise in a radio telescope at Bell Laboratories being used to study our own Galaxy. This excess ``noise'' was isotropic and constant with time, so it couldn't be associated with an isolated celestial source. Wilson and Penzias were puzzled until they were put into touch with Robert Dicke and his research group at Princeton University. Dicke had deduced that the Universe, if it started in a hot dense state, should now be filled with microwave radiation. The timing of the discovery was especially ironic, given that instruments were underway at that time to test the theoretical prediction that such a background should exist.

{\noindent}When the Universe was fully ionized, photons interacted primarily with electrons via Thomson scattering (the low energy limit of Compton scattering): 

\begin{align*}
    \gamma + e^{-} \rightarrow \gamma + e^{-}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Thomson scattering is an elastic process whereby energy and momentum are transferred between the photon and electron. The cross-section for Thomson scattering is the Thomson cross-section of 

\begin{align*}
    \sigma_e = 6.65 \times 10^{-29} ~ [{\rm m^2}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The mean free path of a photon -- that is, the mean distance it travels before scattering from an electron-- is therefore

\begin{align*}
    \ell_\mathrm{mfp} = \frac{1}{n_e\sigma_e} ~ [{\rm m}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}When the baryonic component of the Universe is fully ionized, $n_e = n_p = n_b$. Currently, the number density of baryons is $n_{b,0} = 0.22\,{\rm m^{-3}}$. The number density of conserved particles, such as baryons, goes with the scale factor as $1/a^3$, so when the early Universe was fully ionized, the free electron density was

\begin{align*}
    n_e = n_b = \frac{n_{b,0}}{a^3} ~ [{\rm m^{-3}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Since photons travel with speed $c$, the rate at which a photon undergoes scattering interactions is

\begin{align*}
    \Gamma = \frac{c}{\ell_\mathrm{mfp}} = n_e\sigma_ec ~ [{\rm s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Using the fact that $n_e = n_b = n_{b,0}/a^3$ for a fully-ionized Universe,

\begin{align*}
    \Gamma = \frac{n_{b,0}\sigma_ec}{a^3} = \frac{4.4\times10^{-21}}{a^3} ~ [{\rm s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The photons remain coupled to the electrons as long as their scattering rate, $\Gamma$, is larger than $H$, the rate at which the Universe expands; this is equivalent to saying that their mean free path $\ell_\mathrm{mfp}$ is shorter than the Hubble distance $c/H$.

{\noindent}Measuring the spectrum of the CMB, and confirming that it is indeed a blackbody, is not a simple task, even with modern technology. The current energy per CMB photon, $\sim 6 \times 10^{−4}\,{\rm eV}$, is tiny compared to the energy required to break up an atomic nucleus ($\sim 1\,{\rm MeV}$) or even the energy required to ionize an atom ($\sim 10\,{\rm eV}$). However, the mean photon energy is comparable to the energy of vibration or rotation for a small molecule such as H$_2$O. Thus, CMB photons can zip along for more than 13 billion years through the tenuous intergalactic medium, then be absorbed a microsecond away from the Earth’s surface by a water molecule in the atmosphere. Microwaves with wavelengths shorter than λ ∼ 3 cm are strongly absorbed by water molecules.

{\noindent}The CMB can be measured at wavelengths shorter than 3 cm by observing from high-altitude balloons or from the South Pole, where the combination of cold temperatures and high altitude keeps the atmospheric humidity low. The best way to measure the spectrum of the CMB, however, is to go completely above the damp atmosphere of the Earth. The CMB spectrum was first measured accurately over a wide range of wavelengths by the COsmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, launched in 1989, into an orbit 900 km above the Earth’s surface. COBE actually contained three different instruments. The Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment (DIRBE) was designed to measure radiation at the wavelengths $0.001\,{\rm mm}<\lambda<0.24\,{\rm mm}$; at these wavelengths, it was primarily detecting stars and dust within our own Galaxy. The second instrument, called the Far InfraRed Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS), was used to measure the spectrum of the CMB in the range $0.1\,{\rm mm} < \lambda < 10\,{\rm mm}$, a wavelength band which includes the peak in the CMB spectrum. The third instrument, called the Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR), was designed to make full-sky maps of the CMB at three different wavelengths: $\lambda = 3.3\,{\rm mm}$, $5.7\,{\rm mm}$, and $9.6\,{\rm mm}$.

{\noindent}The most important fact we learned from our first 25 years of surveying the CMB was that the early Universe was very smooth. No anisotropies were detected in the early CMB. This period, while undoubtedly frustrating for observers searching for anisotropies, solidified the view of a smooth Big Bang. We are now moving on. We have discovered anisotropies in the CMB, indicating that the early Universe was not completely smooth. There were small perturbations in the cosmic plasma. To understand these, we must go beyond the Standard Model.

\subsection{Question 5}

Define and describe the ``tired light hypothesis" and the ``steady state Universe'' as alternatives to the Big Bang. How have they been disproved observationally?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

{\noindent}\textbf{Tired Light Hypothesis:} The Tired Light Hypothesis states that the Universe is not expanding, but that photons simply lose energy as they move through space (by some unexplained means). Such a Universe would leads to a blurring of distant objects which is not observed.

{\noindent}\textbf{Steady State Theory:} The Steady State Theory states that matter is continuously being created as the Universe expands in such a way that the matter density remains constant, therefore discarding a beginning to the Universe and adhering to a perfect cosmological principle. The discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background is commonly regarded as the observation which decisively tipped the scales in favor of the Big Bang model.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}\textbf{Tired Light Hypothesis:} The Tired Light Hypothesis states that the Universe is not expanding, but that photons simply lose energy as they move through space (by some unexplained means), with an exponential dependence on distance $r$ as

\begin{align*}
    E = E_0 \mathrm{e}^{(-r/R_0)} ~ [{\rm eV}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $R_0$ is some constant. There is no known interaction that can degrade a photon's energy without also changing its momentum, which leads to a blurring of distant objects which is not observed.

{\noindent}\textbf{Steady State Theory:} The Steady State model was first proposed in the 1940's by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Fred Hoyle, who were proponents of the \textit{perfect cosmological principle}, which states that not only are there no privileged locations in space, there are no privileged moments in time. Thus, a Steady State Universe is one in which the global properties of the Universe, such as the mean density $\rho_0$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$, remain constant with time. It was proposed as an alternate theory to the Big Bang model of the Universe which states that matter is continuously being created as the Universe expands in such a way that the matter density remains constant, therefore discarding a beginning to the Universe and adhering to a perfect cosmological principle. Though the Steady State Theory is largely discredited today, its popularity in the 1940's pushed for supporting evidence of the Big Bang model. Interestingly, it was Fred Hoyle who coined the term `Big Bang' during a 1949 BBC interview: ``These theories were based on the hypothesis that all matter in the Universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.''

{\noindent}In a Steady State Universe, the velocity-distance relation can be easily integrated:

\begin{align*}
    v &= H_0r ~ [{\rm km\,s^{-1}}]\\
    \frac{dr}{dt} &= H_0r \\
    \int \frac{dr}{r} &= \int H_0 dt \\
    \ln (r) &= H_0t \\
    r(t) &\propto e^{H_0t} [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Note that $r \rightarrow 0$ only in the limit that $t \rightarrow -\infty$, so a Steady State Universe is infinitely old. If there existed an instant in time at which the Universe started expanding (as in a Big Bang model), that would be a special moment, in violation of the assumed ``perfect cosmological principle''. 

{\noindent}The volume of a spherical region of space, in a Steady State model, increases exponentially with time:

\begin{align*}
    V(t) = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \propto e^{H_0t} = e^{3H_0t} ~ [{\rm Mpc^3}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}However, if the Universe is in a steady state, the density of the sphere must remain constant. To have a constant density of matter within a growing volume, matter must be continuously created at a rate of

\begin{align*}
    \dot{M(t)}_{SS} = \rho_0 \dot{V(t)} = \rho_0 3 H_0 V(t) ~ [{\rm kg\,Gyr^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If our own Universe, with matter density $\rho_0 \sim 3 \times 10^{-27}\,{\rm kg\,m^{−3}}$, happened to be a Steady State Universe, then matter would have to be created at a rate of 

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\dot{M(t)}_{SS}}{V(t)} = 3H_0\rho_0 \sim 6\times10^{-29} ~ [{\rm kg\,m^{-3}\,Gyr^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}which corresponds to creating roughly one hydrogen atom per cubic kilometer per year.

{\noindent}The Steady State model finally fell out of favor when observational evidence increasingly indicated that the perfect cosmological principle is not true; the properties of the Universe \textit{do}, in fact, change with time. The discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background is commonly regarded as the observation which decisively tipped the scales in favor of the Big Bang model.

\subsection{Question 6}

Why are only very light elements (H, D, He, and traces of Li) synthesized in the first three minutes of the Big Bang?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Deuterium synthesis acted as the first bottleneck for nucleosynthesis of heavier elements. The deuteron (i.e., deuterium nucleus) has a binding energy of $2.225\,{\rm MeV}$ which is only $4.3$ times larger than $m_ec^2$ and $1.7$ times larger than the neutron-proton mass-energy difference. Therefore, typical photons are energetic enough to easily photoionize deuterium. The Universe must therefore cool to $T\sim10^9\,{\rm K}$, just below the binding energy of deuterium for the equilibrium to swing in favour of deuterium synthesis. This occurs at $t\sim3\,{\rm min}$. All the while, free neutrons are decaying with a half life of $t_n\sim15\,{\rm min}$. Since the simplest way to synthesize helium is by fusing deuterium, helium synthesis must await significant quantities of deuterium which happens at a temperature roughly one third that at which helium would be expected to dominate. Once significant nucleosynthesis begins, deuterium is rapidly converted into helium owing to its greater binding energy per nucleon ($7\,{\rm MeV}$ as opposed to $1.1\,{\rm MeV}$ for deuterium). This occurs at a temperature of roughly $0.1\,{\rm MeV}$, by which point the density and temperature of the Universe are too low for significant synthesis of heavier nuclei to proceed. 

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}At sufficiently early times, the temperature of the Universe was that of the centre of the Sun ($1.55\times10^7\,{\rm K}$), where we know that nuclear reactions occur. Starting in the 1940's, Gamow considered the fascinating question of whether nuclear reactions were possible in the early Universe. He noted that the abundances of some elements in stars showed great regularities, especially a universal proportion of about 25\% helium by mass. This led to the vision that a chain of nuclear reactions in the early Universe could generate not only helium, but all elements. In 1957, the Burbidges, Fowler \& Hoyle showed that almost all elements could in fact be generated in stars, but the problem of helium remained. Gamow showed that its existence could be used to predict the present radiation temperature (as argued below).

{\noindent}It will be convenient to refer to particle masses and temperatures in nuclear physics units, which are ${\rm MeV}$. Some useful conversions are:

\begin{align*}
    1\,{\rm MeV} &= 10^{10.065}\,{\rm K} \\
    m_ec^2 &= 0.511\,{\rm MeV} \\
    m_pc^2 &= 939\,{\rm MeV} \\
    (m_n-m_p)c^2 &= 1.3\,{\rm MeV}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}\textit{Neutron freezeout:}

{\noindent}After the annihilation between matter and anti-matter (below $\sim10^{13}\,{\rm K}$), the balance between neutrons and protons are maintained in equilibrium by weak interactions:

\begin{align*}
    p + e^-n \leftrightarrow n + \nu \\
    n + e^+ \leftrightarrow p + \bar{\nu}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}While this persists, the relative number densities of neutrons and protons should vary according to a Boltzmann factor based on their rest energy difference of $1.3\,{\rm MeV}$:

\begin{align*}
    \frac{n_n}{n_p} = e^{-\Delta mc^2/k_BT} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The reason that neutrons exist today is that the timescale for the weak interactions needed to keep this equilibrium set up eventually becomes longer than the expansion timescale. The reactions thus rapidly cease, and the proton-neutron ratio undergoes freezeout at some characteristic value which determined the He abundance. Since most He is $^4$He (i.e., two neutrons and two protons), the Helium mass fraction (denoted $Y$) is given by

\begin{align*}
    Y = \frac{4\times n_n/2}{n_n + n_p}  = \frac{2}{1 + n_n/n_n} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}neglecting neutrons in other elements. So, $Y=0.25$ requires a neutron-proton freezeout $n_n/n_p\simeq1/7$. To calculate when the neutron-proton ratio undergoes freezeout, we need to know the rates of weak nuclear reactions. Fermi discovered how to calculate the relevant cross sections in the 1930s. Remember that, at $T\sim10^{10}~{\rm K}$, we are above the electron-proton energy threshold, so there exist thermal populations of both electrons and neutrinos to make the reaction $p+e^- \leftrightarrow n+\nu$ go equally well in either direction. All that is needed, therefore, is to consider either the reaction timescale for one proton immersed in a thermal bath of electrons or of one neutron immersed in a bath of neutrinos (the rates are the same). When this timescale equals the local Hubble time, $a(t)/\dot{a}(t)$, we get freezeout of the proton-neutron ratio. Taking the known weak interaction rates, this happens at

\begin{align*}
    T(n~{\rm freezeout}) \simeq 10^{10.14} {\rm K} \Rightarrow \frac{n_n}{n_p} \simeq 0.34.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This number is not a precisely correct result because nucleosynthesis is a process that contains a number of interesting (but potentially confusing) coincidences:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The freezeout condition was calculated assuming a temperature well above the electron mass threshold, but freezeout actually happens only a very little above this critical temperature.
  \item Neutrons are not stable: they decay spontaneously with the $e$-folding lifetime of $\tau_n=887\pm2\,{\rm s}$. Unless the frozen-out neutrons can be locked away in nuclei before $t=887\,{\rm s}$, the relic abundance will decay freely to zero. The freezeout point occurs at an age of a few seconds, so there are only a few $e$-foldings of expansion available in which to salvage some neutrinos.
\end{enumerate}

{\noindent}\textit{Locking up the neutrons:}

{\noindent}It may seem implausible that we can add one more coincidence -- i.e., that nuclear reactions will become important at about the same time -- this is just what happens. The Deuteron binding energy of $2.225\,{\rm MeV}$ is only $4.3$ times larger than $m_ec^2$ and only $1.7$ times larger than the neutron-proton mass difference. At higher temperatures, the strong interaction $n+p \leftrightarrow \mathrm{D}+\gamma$ is fast enough to produce deuterium, but thermal equilibrium favours a small deuterium fraction -- i.e., typical photons are energetic enough to disrupt deuterium nuclei very easily. The second key temperature in nucleosynthesis is therefore where the Universe has cooled sufficiently for the equilibrium to swing in favour of deuterium. In practice, this happens at a temperature a little below the deuteron binding energy. This is because the large photon to baryon ratio: even if photons lack sufficient energy to disintegrate deuterons, the rare ones in the tail of the distribution can still do the job. 

{\noindent}Nevertheless, the temperature at which deuterium switches from being rare to dominating the equilibrium is still at $k_BT$ of order the deuterium binding energy:

\begin{align*}
    T({\mathrm{Deuterium~formation}}) \simeq 10^{8.9}\,[{\rm K}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}or at a time of about 3 minutes.

{\noindent}Notice that we have not needed to know the nuclear reaction rates that form deuterium, since the argument is an equilibrium one. However, if the matter density is too low, the nuclear reactions will freeze out before much deuterium has formed. Gamow took the known nuclear cross-sections and argued that the typical reaction time for deuterium formation had to be the cosmological age at that time (i.e., 3 minutes). This let him conclude that the matter density must have been about $10^{-3}\,{\rm kg\,m^{-3}}$ at that time. This gives a ratio of number densities of photons to nucleons, which is preserved as the Universe expands. Therefore, the present-day matter density allows a prediction of the present-day photon density, and hence its temperature. Alpher \& Herman used Gamow's argument to predict a current photon temperature of $4\,{\rm K}$ to $5\,{\rm K}$, which is impressively accurate. On the other hand, this prediction was based on a figure for the $z=0$ matter density that is probably too low by at least a factor of $100$, raising the temperature estimate by a factor of about 5. Actually, Gamow's argument is an inequality: there is a minimum matter density at $10^9\,{\rm K}$, but it could have been higher. The prediction for the current temperature is therefore really an upper limit. It works because the nuclear reactions are not too far from freeze out when deuterium forms.

{\noindent}The deuterium measurements (Buries and Tytler, 1998) are the new developments in the field. These measurements are so exciting because they explore the deuterium abundance at redshifts of order 3-4, well before much processing could have altered the primordial abundances. Figure \ref{fig:deuterium} shows one such detection. The basic idea is that light from distant QSOs is absorbed by intervening neutral hydrogen systems. The key absorption feature arises from transition from the ground state ($n=1$) of hydrogen to the first excited state ($n=2$), requiring a photon with wavelength $\lambda = 1215.7$ \AA. Since photons are absorbed when exciting hydrogen in this fashion, there is a trough in the spectrum at {\AA}, redshifted by a factor of $(1+z)$. The corresponding line from deuterium should be (i) shifted over by $0.33(1+z)$ {\AA} and (ii) much less damped since there is much less deuterium. Figure \ref{fig:deuterium} shows just such a system; there are now half a dozen with detections precisely in the neighborhood shown in Figure \ref{fig:bbn_prediction}. Note that the steep decline in deuterium as a function of baryon density helps here: even relatively large errors in deuterium measurements translate into small errors on the baryon density.

{\noindent}\textit{Formation of helium:}

{\noindent}The argument so far has produced a Universe consisting of just hydrogen and deuterium, but this is not realistic as one would expect $^4$He to be preferred on thermodynamic grounds, owing to its greater biding energy per nucleon ($7\,{\rm MeV}$ as opposed to $1.1\,{\rm MeV}$ for deuterium). In equilibrium, the first nuclei to come into existence in significant numbers should be $^4$He: the abundance of $^4$He relative to protons should reach unity at an energy of about $0.3\,{\rm MeV}$, at which point the relative abundance of deuterium is only $\sim10^{-12}$.

{\noindent}Since the simplest way to synthesize helium is by fusing deuterium, it is no surprise that the equilibrium prediction fails miserably in the expanding Universe: the production of helium must await the synthesis of significant quantities of deuterium which we have seen happens at a temperature roughly one third that at which helium would be expected to dominate. What the thermodynamic argument does show, however, is that it is expected that deuterium will be rapidly converted to helium once significant nucleosynthesis begins. This argument is what allows us to expect that the helium abundance can be calculated from the final $n_n/n_p$ ratio. The main reactions of importance are of course $2$-body ones, rather than the improbable coincidence of $2$ protons and $2$ neutrons all arriving at the same place simultaneously to make $^4$He in one go. The process starts by fusing deuterium to make either tritium and $^3$He, following which there are four main ways of reaching $^4$He (leaving aside rarer reactions involving residual free neutrons):

\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{D} &\leftrightarrow \mathrm{^3He} + n \\
    \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{D} &\leftrightarrow \mathrm{T} + p \\ \\
    \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{D} &\leftrightarrow \mathrm{^4He} \\
    \mathrm{T} + p &\leftrightarrow \mathrm{^4He} \\
    \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{^3He} &\leftrightarrow \mathrm{^4He} + p \\
    \mathrm{D} + \mathrm{T} &\leftrightarrow \mathrm{^4He} + n.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The same thermodynamic arguments that say helium should be favoured at temperatures around $0.1\,{\rm MeV}$ say that more massive nuclei would be preferred in equilibrium at lower temperatures still. A Universe that stayed in nuclear equilibrium as it cooled would eventually consist entirely of iron since this has the largest binding energy per nucleon. However, by the time helium synthesis is accomplished, the density and temperature are too low for significant synthesis of heavier nuclei to proceed. Apart from helium, the main nuclear residue of the Big Bang is therefore those deuterium nuclei that escape being mopped up into helium, plus a trace of $^3$He. The other intermediate produce, tritium, is not so strongly bound and and thus leaves no significant relic. There also exists extremely small fractions of other elements: $^7$Li ($\sim10^{-9}$ by mass) and $^7Be$ ($\sim10^{-11}$ by mass). The helium content in the Universe changes later by nuclear fusion in stars, which also forms heavier nuclei (`metals'). However, the total amount of helium produced in stars is expected to be smaller by about one order of magnitude compared to that in BBN.

{\noindent}In summary, nucleosynthesis starts at about $10^{10}\,{\rm K}$ when the Universe was about $1\,{\rm s}$ old, and effectively ends when it has cooled by a factor of 10, and is about 100 times older.

\subsection{Question 7}

Explain how and why Type Ia supernovae are used in the measurements of cosmological parameters.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Type 1a are good standard candles -- they are very luminous and standardized. The average Type 1a has a peak luminosity of $L=4\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$ which is 100,000 times brighter than even the brightest Cepheid variable. When $z\ll1$, the luminosity distance to the light source is

\begin{align*}
    d_L \approx \frac{c}{H_0}z \left(1+\frac{1-q_0}{2}z\right) ~ [{\rm Mpc}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The recipe for finding the Hubble constant and deceleration parameters is a simple one:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Measure the redshift $z$ and flux $F$ for each SN.
    \item Compute the luminosity distance $d_L=\sqrt{L/4\pi F}$ for each SN.
    \item Plot the recessional velocity $cz$ versus luminosity distance $d_L$.
    \item Measure the slope of the $cz$ versus $d_L$ relation when $z\ll1$; this gives $H_0$.
    \item At slightly larger values of $z$ (but still $<1$), the deviation of the plot from a straight line tells you the value of $q_0$.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}In recent years, the standard candle of choice among cosmologists has been Type Ia supernovae (SNe). A supernova may be loosely defined as an exploding star. Early in the history of supernova studies, when little was known about their underlying physics, supernovae were divided into two classes, on the basis of their spectra. Type I supernovae contain no hydrogen absorption lines in their spectra; Type II supernovae contain strong hydrogen absorption lines. Gradually, it was realized that all Type II supernovae are the same species of beast; they are massive stars ($M>8\,M_\odot$) whose cores collapse to form a black hole or neutron star when their nuclear fuel is exhausted. During the rapid collapse of the core, the outer layers of the star are thrown off into space. Type I supernovae are actually two separate species, which are called Type Ia and Type Ib. Type Ib supernovae, it is thought, are massive stars whose cores collapse after the hydrogen-rich outer layers of the star have been blown away in strong stellar winds. Thus, Type Ib and Type II supernovae are driven by very similar mechanisms -- their differences are superficial, in the most literal sense. Type Ia supernovae, however, are something completely different. They occur in close binary systems where one of the two stars in the system is a white dwarf; that is, a stellar remnant which is supported against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure. The transfer of mass from the companion star to the white dwarf eventually nudges the white dwarf over the Chandrasekhar limit of $1.4\,M_\odot$; this is the maximum mass at which the electron degeneracy pressure can support a white dwarf against its own self-gravity. When the Chandrasekhar limit is exceeded, the white dwarf starts to collapse until its increased density triggers a runaway nuclear fusion reaction. The entire white dwarf becomes a fusion bomb, blowing itself to smithereens; unlike Type II supernovae, Type Ia supernovae do not leave a condensed stellar remnant behind.

{\noindent}Within our Galaxy, Type Ia supernovae occur roughly once per century, on average. Although Type Ia supernovae are not frequent occurrences locally, they are extraordinarily luminous, and hence can be seen to large distances. The luminosity of an average Type Ia supernova, at peak brightness, is $L=4\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$; that’s 100,000 times more luminous than even the brightest Cepheid. For a few days, a Type Ia supernova in a moderately bright galaxy can outshine all the other stars in the galaxy combined. Since moderately bright galaxies can be seen at $z\sim1$, this means that Type Ia supernovae can also be seen at $z\sim1$. Not only are Type Ia supernovae bright standard candles, they are also reasonably standardized standard candles. Consider Type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster. Although there’s only one Type Ia supernova per century in our own Galaxy, the total luminosity of the Virgo cluster is a few hundred times that of our Galaxy. Thus, every year you can expect a few type Ia supernovae to go off in the Virgo cluster. Several type Ia supernovae have been observed in the Virgo cluster in the recent past, and have been found to have similar fluxes at maximum brightness.

{\noindent}So far, Type Ia supernovae sound like ideal standard candles; very luminous and very standardized. There’s one complication, however. Observation of supernovae in galaxies whose distances have been well determined by Cepheids reveal that Type Ia supernovae do not have identical luminosities. Instead of all having $L = 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$, their peak luminosities lie in the fairly broad range $L = 3\rightarrow5\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$. However, it has also been noted that the peak luminosity of a Type Ia supernova is tightly correlated with the shape of its light curve. Type Ia supernovae with luminosities the shoot up rapidly and decline rapidly are less luminous than average at their peak; supernovae with luminosities which rise and fall in a more leisurely manner are more luminous than average at their peak. Thus, just as the period of a Cepheid tells you its luminosity, the rise and fall time of a Type Ia supernova tells you its peak luminosity.

{\noindent}Recently, two research teams, the ``Supernova Cosmology Project'' and the ``High-z Supernova Search Team'', have been conducting searches for supernovae in distant galaxies. They have used the observed light curves and redshifts of Type Ia supernovae to measure cosmological parameters. First, by observing Type Ia supernovae at $z\sim0.1$, the value of $H_0$ can be determined. The results of the different groups are in reasonable agreement with each other. If the distance to the Virgo cluster is pegged at $d_L = 15\,{\rm Mpc}$, as indicated by the Cepheid results, then the observed supernovae fluxes and redshifts are consistent with $H_0 = 70\pm7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$.

{\noindent}In addition, the supernova groups have been attempting to measure the acceleration (or deceleration) of the Universe by observing Type Ia supernovae at higher redshift. Before discussing these results, let's introduce the ``magnitude'' system used by astronomers to express fluxes and luminosities. The magnitude system, like much else in astronomy, has its roots in ancient Greece. The Greek astronomer Hipparchus, in the second century BC, divided the stars into six classes, according to their apparent brightness. The brightest stars were of ``first magnitude'', the faintest stars visible to the naked eye were of ``sixth magnitude'', and intermediate stars were ranked as second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitude. Long after the time of Hipparchus, it was realized that the response of the human eye is roughly logarithmic, and that stars of the first magnitude have fluxes (at visible wavelengths) about 100 times greater than stars of the sixth magnitude. On the basis of this realization, the magnitude system was placed on a more rigorous mathematical basis.

{\noindent}Nowadays, the bolometric apparent magnitude of a light source is defined in terms of the source’s bolometric flux as

\begin{align*}
    m \equiv -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{F}{F_0}\right) ~ [{\rm mag}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the reference flux $F_0$ is set at the value $F_0 = 2.53\times10^{-8}\,[{\rm W\,m^{-2}}]$. Thanks to the negative sign in the definition, a small value of $m$ corresponds to a large flux $F$. For instance, the flux of sunlight at the Earth’s location is $F = 1367\,[{\rm W\,m^{-2}}]$; the Sun thus has a bolometric apparent magnitude of $m = −26.8$. The choice of reference flux $F_0$ constitutes a tip of the hat to Hipparchus, since for stars visible to the naked eye it typically yields $0 < m < 6$.

{\noindent}The bolometric absolute magnitude of a light source is defined as the apparent magnitude that it would have if it were at a luminosity distance of $d_L = 10\,{\rm pc}$. Thus, a light source with luminosity L has a bolometric absolute magnitude

\begin{align*}
    M \equiv -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) ~ [{\rm mag}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the reference luminosity is $L_0=78.7\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$, since that is the luminosity of an object which produces a flux $F_0 = 2.53\times10^{-8}\,[{\rm W\,m^{-2}}]$ when viewed from a distance of $10\,{\rm pc}$. The bolometric absolute magnitude of the Sun is thus $M = 4.74$. Although the system of apparent and absolute magnitudes seems strange to the uninitiated, the apparent magnitude is really nothing more than a logarithmic measure of the flux, and the absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the luminosity.

{\noindent}Given the definitions of apparent and absolute magnitude, the relation between an object’s apparent magnitude and its absolute magnitude can be written in the form

\begin{align*}
    M = m -5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d_L}{10\,{\rm pc}}\right) ~ [{\rm mag}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $d_L$ is the luminosity distance to the light source. If the luminosity distance is given in units of megaparsecs, this relation becomes

\begin{align*}
    M = m -5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d_L}{1\,{\rm Mpc}}\right)-25 ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Since astronomers frequently quote fluxes and luminosities in terms of apparent and absolute magnitudes, they find it convenient to quote luminosity distances in terms of the distance modulus to a light source. The distance modulus is defined as $m-M$, and is related to the luminosity distance by the relation

\begin{align*}
    m - M = 5\log_{10}\left(\frac{d_L}{1\,{\rm Mpc}}\right)-25 ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), for instance, at $d_L = 0.05\,{\rm Mpc}$, is $m - M = 18.5$. The distance modulus of the Virgo cluster, at $d_L = 15\,{\rm Mpc}$, is $m - M = 30.9$. 

{\noindent}Unfortunately, the current proper distance to a Type 1a supernova is not a measurable property. If you tried to measure the distance with a tape measure, for instance, the distance would be continuously increasing as you extended the tape. To measure the proper distance at time $t_0$, you would need a tape measure which could be extended with infinite speed; alternatively, you would need to stop the expansion of the Universe at its current scale factor while you measured the distance at your leisure. Neither of these alternatives is physically possible.

{\noindent}Since cosmology is ultimately based on observations, if we want to find the distance to a galaxy, we need some way of computing a distance from that galaxy’s observed properties. For objects at cosmological distances, we can measure the flux of light, $F$, from the object. The complete flux, integrated over all wavelengths of light, is called the bolometric flux. (A bolometer is an extremely sensitive thermometer capable of detecting electromagnetic radiation over a wide range of wavelengths; it was invented in 1881 by the astronomer Samuel Langley, who used it to measure solar radiation.) More frequently, given the difficulties of measuring the true bolometric flux, the flux over a limited range of wavelengths is measured. If the light from the object has emission or absorption lines, we can measure the redshift, $z$.

{\noindent}Since Type 1a supernovae are standard candles in the sense that their luminosities can be measured, then you can use its measured flux $F$ to define a function called the luminosity distance:

\begin{align*}
    d_L \equiv \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}} ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The function $d_L$ is called a ``distance'' because its dimensionality is that of a distance, and because it is what the proper distance to the standard candle would be if the Universe were static and Euclidean. In a static Euclidean Universe, the propagation of light follows the inverse square law $F = L/(4\pi d^2)$.

{\noindent}Suppose, though, that you are in a Universe described by a Robertson-Walker metric:

\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{d}s^2 = - c^2\mathrm{d}t^2 + a(t)^2(\mathrm{d}r^2 + S_\kappa(r)^2\mathrm{d}\Omega^2),
\end{align*}

{\noindent}with 

\begin{align*}
    S_\kappa(r) =
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
    R\sin(r/R), ~~~~~& (\kappa = +1) \\
              r,~~~~~& (\kappa = 0) \\
    R\sinh(r/R),~~~~~& (\kappa = -1)
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
    .
\end{align*}

{\noindent}You are at the origin. At the present moment $t = t_0$, you see light that was emitted by a standard candle at comoving coordinate location $(r,\theta,\phi)$ at a time $t_e$. The photons which were emitted at time $t_e$ are, at the present moment, spread over a sphere of proper radius $d_p(t_0) = r$ and proper surface area $A_p(t_0)$. If space is flat $(\kappa=0)$, then the proper area of the sphere is given by the Euclidean relation $A_p(t_0) = 4\pi d_p(t_0)^2 = 4\pi r^2$. More generally, however,

\begin{align*}
    A_p(t_0) = 4\pi S_\kappa(r)^2 ~ [{\rm Mpc^2}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}When space is positively curved, $A_p(t_0) < 4\pi r^2$, and the photons are spread over a smaller area than they would be in flat space. When space is negatively curved, $A_p(t_0) > 4\pi r^2$, and photons are spread over a larger area than they would be in flat space.

{\noindent}In addition to these geometric effects, which would apply even in a static Universe, the expansion of the Universe causes the observed flux of light from a standard candle of redshift $z$ to be decreased by a factor of $(1+z)^{−2}$. First, the expansion of the Universe causes the energy of each photon from the standard candle to decrease. If a photon starts with an emitted energy $E = hc/λ$ when the scale factor is $a(t)$, by the time we observe it when the scale factor is A$a(t_0) = 1$, the wavelength will have grown to

\begin{align*}
    \lambda_0 = \frac{1}{a(t)}\lambda = (1+z)\lambda ~ [{\rm m}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and the energy will have fallen to

\begin{align*}
    E_0 = E(1+z)^{-1} ~ [{\rm eV}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Second, thanks to the expansion of the Universe, the time between photon detections will be greater. If two photons are emitted in the same direction separated by a time interval $\delta t$, the proper distance between them will initially be $c\delta t$; by the time we detect the photons at time $t_0$, the proper distance between them will be stretched to $c\delta t(1 + z)$, and we will detect them separated by a time interval $\delta t_0 = \delta t(1 + z)$.

{\noindent}The net result is that in an expanding, spatially curved Universe, the relation between the observed flux $F$ and the luminosity $L$ of a distant light source is

\begin{align*}
    F = \frac{L}{4\pi S_\kappa(r)^2(1+z)^2} ~ [{\rm W\,m^{-2}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and the luminosity distance is

\begin{align*}
    d_L = S_\kappa(r)(1+z) ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The available evidence indicates that our Universe is nearly flat, with a radius of curvature $R_0$ which is larger than the current horizon distance $d_\mathrm{hor}(t_0)$. Objects with finite redshift are at proper distances smaller than the horizon distance, and hence smaller than the radius of curvature. Thus, it is safe to make the approximation $r \ll R_0$, implying $S\kappa(r) \approx r$. With our assumption that space is very close to being flat, the relation between the luminosity distance and the current proper distance becomes very simple:

\begin{align*}
    d_L(\kappa=0) = r(1+z) = d_p(t_0)(1+z) ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Thus, even if space is perfectly flat, if you estimate the distance to a standard candle by using a naive inverse square law, you will overestimate the actual proper distance by a factor $(1 + z)$.

    {\caption{\footnotesize{The luminosity distance of a standard candle with observed redshift $z$.

    \label{fig:luminositydistance}}
    {\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/cosmology/LuminosityDistance.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:luminositydistance} shows the luminosity distance $d_L$ as a function of redshift $z$ for the Benchmark Model, and for two other flat Universes, one dominated by matter and one dominated by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. When $z \ll 1$, the current proper distance may be approximated as

\begin{align*}
    d_p(t_0) \approx \frac{c}{H_0}z \left(1-\frac{1+q_0}{2}z\right) ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}In a Universe which is nearly flat, the luminosity distance may thus be approximated as

\begin{align*}
    d_L &\approx \frac{c}{H_0}z \left(1-\frac{1+q_0}{2}z\right)(1+z) \\
        & \approx \frac{c}{H_0}z \left(1+\frac{1-q_0}{2}z\right).
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Note that in the limit $z\rightarrow0$,

\begin{align*}
    d_p(t_0) \approx d_L \approx \frac{c}{H_0}z ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}In a Universe described by the Robertson-Walker metric, the luminosity distance is a good approximation to the current proper distance for objects with small redshifts.

{\noindent}Substituting the luminosity distance approximation into the expression for the distance modulus gives us the relation between distance modulus and redshift:

\begin{align*}
    m - M \approx 43.17 - 5\log_{10} \left(\frac{H_0}{70\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc}}\right) + 5\log_{10}z + 1.086(1-q_0)z ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}For a population of standard candles with known luminosity $L$ (and hence of known bolometric absolute magnitude $M$), you measure the flux $F$ (or equivalently, the bolometric apparent magnitude $m$) and the redshift $z$. In the limit $z\rightarrow0$, a plot of $m − M$ versus $log_{10}(z)$ gives a straight line whose amplitude at a given value of $z$ tells you the value of $H_0$. At slightly larger values of $z$, the deviation of the plot from a straight line tells you the value of $q_0$. At a given value of $z$, an accelerating Universe (with $q_0<0$) yields standard candles with a smaller flux than would a decelerating Universe (with $q_0>0$).

{\noindent}The upper panel of Figure \ref{fig:distancemodulus} shows the plot of distance modulus versus redshift for the combined supernova samples of the High-z Supernova Search Team (given by the filled circles) and the Supernova Cosmology Project (given by the open circles). The observational results are compared to the expected results for three model Universes. One Universe is flat, and contains nothing but matter $(\Omega_{m,0}=1, q_0=0.5)$. The second is negatively curved, and contains nothing but matter $(\Omega_{m,0}=0.3, q_0=0.15)$. The third is flat, and contains both matter and a cosmological constant $(\Omega_{m,0}=0.3, \Omega_{\Lambda,0}=0.7, q_0=−0.55).$ The data are best fitted by the third of the models -- which is, in fact, our Benchmark Model. The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:distancemodulus} shows this result more clearly. It shows the difference between the data and the predictions of the negatively curved, matter-only model. The conclusion that the Universe is accelerating derives from the observation that the supernovae seen at $z \sim 0.5$ are, on average, about $0.25\,{\rm mag}$ fainter than they would in a decelerating Universe with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.3$ and no cosmological constant.

{\noindent}The supernova data extend out to $z\sim1$; this is beyond the range where an expansion in terms of $H_0$ and $q_0$ is adequate to describe the scale factor $a(t)$. Thus, the two supernova teams customarily describe their results in terms of a model Universe which contains both matter and a cosmological constant. After choosing values of $\Omega_{m,0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$, they compute the expected relation between $m-M$ and $z$, and compare it to the observed data. The results of fitting these model Universes are given in Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel}. The ovals drawn on Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel} enclose those values of $\Omega{m,0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$ which give the best fit to the supernova data. The results of the two teams (the solid ovals and dotted ovals) give very similar results. Three concentric ovals are shown for each team’s result; they correspond to $1\sigma$, $2\sigma$, and $3\sigma$ confidence intervals, with the inner oval representing the highest probability. The best fitting models lie along the line $0.8\Omega{m,0}-0.6\Omega_{\Lambda,0}\approx-0.2.$ Note that decelerating Universes (with $q_0>0$) can be strongly excluded by the data, as can Big Crunch Universes (labeled `Recollapses' in Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel}), and Big Bounce Universes (labeled `No Big Bang' in Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel}). The supernova data are consistent with negative curvature (labeled `Open' in Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel}), positive curvature (labeled `Closed' in Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel}), or with a Universe which is spatially flat.

{\noindent}The results of the supernova teams made headlines when they were first announced; the discovery of the accelerating Universe was named by Science magazine as the `Scientific Breakthrough of the Year' for 1998. It is prudent to remember, however, that all the hoopla about the accelerating Universe is based on the observation that Type Ia supernova at $z\sim0.5$ and beyond have somewhat lower fluxes (by about 25\%) than they would have in a decelerating Universe. There are other reasons why their fluxes might be low. For instance, if Type Ia supernovae were intrinsically less luminous at $z\sim0.5$ than at $z\sim0$, that could explain their low fluxes. (If a typical supernova at $z\sim0.5$ had $L=3\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$ rather than $L=4\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$, that would explain their observed dimness, without the need to invoke a cosmological constant. Conversely, if the typical supernova at $z\sim0.5$ had $L=5\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$ rather than $L=4\times10^9\,\mathrm{L}_\odot$, that would require an even larger cosmological constant to explain their observed dimness.) However, the other properties of Type Ia supernovae, such as their spectra, don’t seem to evolve with time, so why should their luminosity? Perhaps the fluxes of supernovae at $z\sim0.5$ are low because some of their light is scattered or absorbed by intervening dust. However, dust tends to scatter some wavelengths of light more than others. This would change the shape of the spectrum of distant Type Ia supernovae, but no dependence of spectral shape on redshift is observed.

{\noindent}In sum, the supernova results of Figure \ref{fig:omegamodel} provide persuasive evidence for a nearly flat accelerating Universe with $\Omega_{m,0}\approx0.3$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}\approx0.7$.

\subsubsection{Follow-up Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are Type Ia supernovae (i.e., what is physically happening)?
    \item Can Type Ia constrain all cosmological parameters?
    \item What are some sources of error? (Maximum luminosity is not perfectly consistent but the light curve can be used to calibrate this due to their tight correlation.)
    \item How do we know that redshift can be used as a measurement of distance? (Wanted to hear about Hubble's Law.)
    \item Can other types of supernovae be used as standard candles? Why or why not?

\subsection{Question 8}

Describe two methods, other than Type Ia supernovae, by which the cosmological parameters can be determined by astronomical observations.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

\textbf{CMB Angular Power Spectrum}: Comparisons of the relative strengths of the first few peaks can inform you about $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ since these are the components that caused the oscillations. In addition to this, the smallest multipole moments (i.e., the largest of scales) in the power spectrum can tell you about the modes that were never affected by the sound horizon and should tell you about inflation and the initial conditions that remain unperturbed. In contrast, the largest multipole moments (i.e., the smallest scales) in the power spectrum can tell you about Silk damping.

{\noindent}\textbf{BAOs}: The peaks in the CMB angular power spectrum are the result of compressions and expansions of the baryonic acoustic oscillations: the first and second peaks being the first compression and first decompression, respectively, etc. Given that the first compression happened on scales of the sound horizon at the time of last scattering, the first peak in the CMB angular power spectrum should tell you at what that scale was. This scale (i.e., the sound horizon) can be compared to what would be expected for a flat Universe -- if it is smaller, the Universe is open whereas if it is larger, the Universe is closed (if they're equal, the Universe is of course flat).

\subsubsection{Additional context}

\textbf{CMB Angular Power Spectrum}: The cosmic microwave background consists of photons that last interacted with matter at $z\sim1,100$. Since the Universe must already have been inhomogeneous at this time, in order for the structures present in the current Universe to be able to form, it is expected that these spatial inhomogeneities are visible as a (small) anisotropy of the CMB: \textit{the angular distribution of the CMB temperature reflects the matter inhomogeneities at the redshift of decoupling of radiation and matter}. The CMB anisotropies reflect the conditions in the Universe at the epoch of recombination, thus at $z\sim1,100$. Temperature fluctuations originating at this time are called \textbf{primary anisotropies}. Later, as the CMB photons propagate through the Universe, they may experience a number of distortions along their way which, again, may change their temperature distribution on the sky. These effects then lead to \textbf{secondary anisotropies}.

{\noindent}Of the primary anisotropies (which directly pertain to inhomogeneities at the time of last scattering) the most basic mechanisms can be divided into those which occur on scales larger than the horizon size at recombination, i.e., which can not have been affected by physical interactions up to the time of last scattering, and those on smaller scales. The effects on superhorizon scales are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sachs-Wolfe effect}: Inhomogeneities in the gravitational potential cause photons which originate in regions of higher density to climb out of a potential well. As a result of this, they lose energy and are redshifted (\textbf{gravitational redshift}). This effect is partly compensated for by the fact that, besides the gravitational redshift, a gravitational time delay also occurs: a photon that originates in an overdense region will be scattered at a slightly earlier time, and thus at a slightly higher temperature of the Universe, compared to a photon from a region of average density. Both effects always occur side by side. This results in photons that are cooler in baryon overdensities. (This is the dominant mechanism of primary anisotropies at superhorizon scales.)
    \item \textbf{Peculiar velocities}: The electrons that scatter the CMB photons for the last time do not follow exactly the Hubble expansion, but have an additional velocity that is closely linked to the density fluctuations. This results in a Doppler effect: if photons are scattered by gas receding from us with a speed larger than that corresponding to the Hubble expansion, these photons experience an additional redshift which reduces the temperature measured in that direction.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced baryon density}: The distribution of baryons follows that of the dark matter, so that in regions of a higher dark matter density, the baryon density is also enhanced. This leads to an increased temperature of the baryons in overdense regions.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}These three effects are relevant on scales larger than the (sound) horizon scale at the epoch of recombination. Obviously, they are closely coupled to each other. In particular, on scales $>r_\mathrm{H,com}(z_\mathrm{rec})$, the first two effects can partially compensate each other, though the Sachs-Wolfe effect is the dominant one at superhorizon scales. Inside the (sound) horizon, two other effects dominate the primary anisotropy signal:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Baryon acoustic oscillations}: On subhorizon scales, the pressure of the baryon-photon fluid is effective because, prior to recombination, these two components had been closely coupled by Compton scattering. This leads to sound waves in the baryon-photon fluid, called the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs). In the density peaks of these sound waves, the baryon-photon fluid is adiabatically compressed and thus hotter than the average. The CMB sky yields a two-dimensional cut through this three-dimensional density (and temperature) field of these sound waves, and thus reflect these fluctuations, yielding temperature anisotropies with characteristic length (or angular) scales. (More on this later.)
    \item \textbf{Silk damping}: The coupling of baryons and photons is not perfect since, owing to the finite mean free path of photons, the two components are decoupled on small spatial scales. This implies that on small length-scales, the temperature fluctuations can be smeared out by the diffusion of photons. This process is known as \textbf{Silk damping}, and it implies that on angular scales below about $\sim50'$, only very small primary fluctuations exist.
\end{enumerate}

{\noindent}\textbf{BAOs}: On subhorizon scales, the pressure of the baryon-photon fluid is effective because, prior to recombination, these two components had been closely coupled by Compton scattering. This leads to sound waves in the baryon-photon fluid, called the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs). In the density peaks of these sound waves, the baryon-photon fluid is adiabatically compressed and thus hotter than the average. The CMB sky yields a two-dimensional cut through this three-dimensional density (and temperature) field of these sound waves, and thus reflect these fluctuations, yielding temperature anisotropies with characteristic length (or angular) scales. The length-scale of the resulting density perturbation is given by the sound horizon at recombination; it depends only on the baryon-to-photon and the matter-to-radiation density ratios. The former is proportional to $\Omega_bh^2$ and is determined, e.g., from BBN; the latter is proportional to $\Omega_mh^2$ which is well determined from measurements of the CMB. Together, one finds that the acoustic scale has a comoving value of $r_s\approx150\,{\rm Mpc}$.

{\noindent}We expect that these frozen sound waves of the baryons leave an imprint on the overall matter correlation function, best seen in Figure \ref{fig:perturbationevolution}. This unique feature in the correlation function, if it can be detected in the galaxy correlation function, would provide a well-defined `standard rod' in the observable Universe. Since we can observe only angular scales on the sky, the relation between the (comoving) length of the standard rod and the associated angular scale provides a measure of distance. Therefore, a measurement of the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the correlation of galaxies at a given redshift $z$ can be used to determine the (comoving) angular diameter distance $d_A(z)$ --  which depends on the density parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$.

{\noindent}In fact, the three-dimensional correlation function does not only depend on the transverse length scale which is related to the angular scale via the angular-diameter distance, but also on the separation of galaxies along the line-of-sight. The comoving distance interval corresponding to a redshift interval $\Delta z$ is given by $\Delta x=c\Delta z/H(z)$. Since there are two transversal dimensions, and one along the line-of-sight, the distance measure that is determined best from BAOs is the geometric mean

\begin{align*}
    D(z) = \left(d_A^2(z)\frac{cz}{H(z)}\right)^{1/3}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The large redshift surveys 2dFGRS and SDSS allowed the first detection of these BAOs in the galaxy distribution in 2005. Figure \ref{fig:correlationfunction} shows the discovery of BAOs from the SDSS, where a clear feature in the galaxy correlation function is seen at the expected length scale. The mean redshift of the galaxies from which the correlation function was determined is $z\sim0.35$; thus, this measurement yields an estimate of the angular diameter distance to that redshift, with about a 5\% accuracy.

{\noindent}The power of the method depends on whether the galaxies trace the underlying matter distribution sufficiently well, so that the measured galaxy correlation function reflects the correlation function of matter. Given the large spatial scale on which BAOs are observed, the proportionality between the galaxy and matter fluctuation fields, assumed by the simple bias model, is expected to hold very well. This then turns BAOs into a straightforward, almost purely geometrical tool for measuring the geometry of our Universe.

{\noindent}For this reason, several surveys are underway to measure the acoustic scale as a function of redshift. Figure \ref{fig:BAOs} shows recent measurements of BAOs over a range of redshifts. Amazingly, the measurements are in perfect agreement with the cosmological parameters as determined by CMB anisotropy measurements. In particular, the spatial flatness of our Universe is confirmed, and any curvature is constrained to be very small, $\lvert\Omega_m+\Omega_\Lambda\rvert\lesssim0.01$.

\subsection{Question 9}

Why is the cosmic microwave background expected to be weakly polarized, and what is practically required to observe this signal?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The CMB is linearly polarized at the 10\% level due to \textbf{Thomson scattering} of photons off of free electrons at the surface of last scattering.  The degree of linear polarization is directly related to the quadrupole anisotropy in the photons when they last scatter. If the incoming radiation field were isotropic, orthogonal polarization states from incident directions would balance so that the outgoing radiation would remain unpolarized. Conversely, if the incident radiation field possesses a quadrupolar variation in intensity or temperature (which possess intensity peaks at $90^\circ=\pi/2$ separations), the result is a linear polarization of the scattered radiation. No other multipoles other than the quadrupole contributes to the CMB polarization.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}Why should we be concerned with the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies? That the CMB anisotropies are polarized is a fundamental prediction of the gravitational instability paradigm. Under this paradigm, small fluctuations in the early Universe grow into the large scale structure we see today. If the temperature anisotropies we observe are indeed the result of primordial fluctuations, their presence at last scattering would polarize the CMB anisotropies themselves. The verification of the (partial) polarization of the CMB on small scales would thus represent a fundamental check on our basic assumptions about the behavior of fluctuations in the Universe, in much the same way that the redshift dependence of the CMB temperature is a test of our assumptions about the background cosmology. Furthermore, observations of polarization provide an important tool for reconstructing the model of the fluctuations from the observed power spectrum (as distinct from fitting an a priori model prediction from observations). The polarization probes the epoch of last scattering directly as opposed to the temperature fluctuations which may evolve between last scattering and the present. This localization in time is a very powerful constraint for reconstructing the sources of anisotropy. Moreover, different sources of temperature anisotropies (scalar, vector, and tensor) give different patterns in the polarization: both in its intrinsic structure and in its correlation with the temperature fluctuations themselves. Thus by including polarization information, one can distinguish the ingredients which go to make up the temperature power spectrum and so the cosmological model. Finally, the polarization power spectrum provides information complementary to the temperature power spectrum even for ordinary (scalar or density) perturbations. This can be of use in breaking parameter degeneracies and thus constraining cosmological parameters more accurately. The prime example of this is the degeneracy, within the limitations of cosmic variance, between a change in the normalization and an epoch of ``late'' reionization.

{\noindent}Yet how polarized are the fluctuations? The degree of linear polarization is directly related to the quadrupole anisotropy in the photons when they last scatter. While the exact properties of the polarization depend on the mechanism for producing the anisotropy, several general properties arise. The polarization peaks at angular scales smaller than the horizon at last scattering due to causality. Furthermore, the polarized fraction of the temperature anisotropy is small since only those photons that last scattered in an optically thin region could have possessed a quadrupole anisotropy. The fraction depends on the duration of last scattering. For the standard thermal history, it is 10\% on a characteristic scale of tens of arcminutes. Since temperature anisotropies are at the $10^{-5}$ level, the polarized signal is at (or below) the $10^{-6}$ level, or several $\mu\mathrm{K}$ representing a significant experimental challenge.

{\noindent}The Thomson scattering cross section $\sigma_T$ depends on polarization as (see, e.g., Chandrasekhar, 1960) as 

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_T}{\mathrm{d}\Omega} \propto \lvert \bm{\epsilon}\cdot\bm{\epsilon}' \rvert^2,
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\bm{\epsilon}$ and $\bm{\epsilon}'$ are the incident and scattered polarization directions, and $\Omega$ is the solid angle. Heuristically, the incident light sets up oscillations of the target electron in the direction of the electric field vector $E$ (i.e., the polarization). The scattered radiation intensity thus peaks in the direction normal to, with polarization parallel to, the incident polarization. More formally, the polarization dependence of the cross section is dictated by electromagnetic gauge invariance and thus follows from very basic principles of fundamental physics.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={right,top},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{\\Thomson scattering of radiation with a quadrupole anisotropy generates linear polarization. Blue colors (thick lines) represent hot and red colors (thin lines) cold radiation. Figure taken from Hu \& White (1997).}}
    \label{fig:Thomsonscattering}}
    {\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/cosmology/ThomsonScattering.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}If the incoming radiation field were isotropic, orthogonal polarization states from incident directions separated by $90^\circ$ would balance so that the outgoing radiation would remain unpolarized. Conversely, if the incident radiation field possesses a quadrupolar variation in intensity or temperature (which possess intensity peaks at $90^\circ=\pi/2$ separations), the result is a linear polarization of the scattered radiation (see Figure \ref{fig:Thomsonscattering}). A reversal in sign of the temperature fluctuation corresponds to a $90^\circ$ rotation of the polarization, which reflects the spin-$2$ nature of polarization.

{\noindent}In terms of a multipole decomposition of the radiation field into spherical harmonics, $Y_\ell^m(\theta,\phi)$, the five quadrupole moments are represented by $\ell= 2, m=0,\pm1,\pm2$. The orthogonality of the spherical harmonics guarantees that no other moment can generate polarization from Thomson scattering. In these spherical coordinates, with the north pole at $\theta=0$, we call a N-S (E-W) polarization component $Q>0$ ($Q<0$) and a NE-SW (NW-SE) component $U>0$ ($U<0$). The polarization amplitude and angle clockwise from north are

\begin{align*}
    P = \sqrt{Q^2+U^2}
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and

\begin{align*}
    \chi = \frac{1}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{U}{Q}\right).
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $P$ is the polarized intensity and $Q$ and $U$ are the linear polarization Stokes vectors.

{\noindent}If Thomson scattering is rapid, then the randomization of photon directions that results destroys any quadrupole anisotropy and polarization. The problem of understanding the polarization pattern of the CMB thus reduces to understanding the quadrupolar temperature fluctuations at last scattering. Temperature perturbations have 3 geometrically distinct sources: the scalar (compressional), vector (vertical) and tensor (gravitational wave) perturbations. Formally, they form the irreducible basis of the symmetric metric tensor. We shall consider each of these in Question 17 and show that the scalar, vector, and tensor quadrupole anisotropy correspond to $m=0,\pm1,\pm2$ respectively. This leads to different patterns of polarization for the three sources.

\subsection{Question 10}

Our view of the cosmic microwave background is affected by what is along the line of sight. Give two examples of CMB foregrounds that also provide information about the cosmic parameters.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect}. Since galaxy clusters are separated by $\sim150\,{\rm Mpc}$, this will increase the power of the first peakin the CMB power spectrum and can inform us about $\Omega_m$.
    \item \textbf{Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect} (primary anisotropy which dominates on superhorizon scales).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}The CMB consists of photons that last interacted with matter at $z\sim1100$. Since the Universe must already have been inhomogeneous at this time, in order for the structures present in the current Universe to be able to form, it is expected that these spatial inhomogeneities are visible as a (small) anisotropy of the CMB: the angular distribution of the CMB temperature reflects the matter inhomogeneities at the redshift of decoupling of radiation and matter.

{\noindent}Since the discovery of the CMB in 1965, such anisotropies have been searched for. Under the assumption that the matter in the Universe solely consists of baryons, the expectation was that we would find relative fluctuations in the CMB temperature of amplitude $\Delta T/T10^{-3}$ on scales of a few arcminutes. This expectation is based on the theory of gravitational instability for structure growth: to account for the density fluctuations observed today where the density contrast $\delta\sim1$ on scales of $\sim10h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$, one needs relative density fluctuations at $z\sim1000$ of order $D_+(z=1000)\sim10^{-3}$. Despite increasingly more sensitive observations, such fluctuations were not detected. The upper limits resulting from these searches for anisotropies provided one of the arguments that, in the mid-1980s, caused the idea of the existence of dark matter on cosmic scales to increasingly enter the minds of cosmologists. In a Universe which is dominated by dark matter the expected CMB fluctuations on small angular scales are considerably smaller than in a purely baryonic Universe. It was the COBE satellite with which temperature fluctuations in the CMB were finally observed in 1992 (Figure \ref{fig:cmbcobe}), a discovery which was awarded the Physics Nobel Prize in 2006. Over the following years, sensitive and significant measurements of the CMB anisotropy were carried out using balloons and ground-based telescopes. Two more satellites have observed the full microwave sky, WMAP and Planck; their results, together with ground-based measurements at smaller angular scales, have yielded the most stringent constraints on cosmological parameters yet.

    {\caption{\footnotesize{Temperature distribution of the CMB on the sky as measured by the COBE satellite. The top image shows a dipole distribution; it originates from the Earth's motion relative to the restframe of the CMB. Our Solar System moves at a speed of $369\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ relative to that system, which leads to a dipole anisotropy with an amplitude of $\Delta T/T\sim v/c\sim1.2\times10^{-3}$ due to the Doppler effect. If this dipole contribution is subtracted, we get the map in the middle which clearly shows the emission from the Galactic disk. Since this emission has a different spectral energy distribution (it is not a blackbody of $T\sim3\,{\rm K}$), it can also be subtracted to get the temperature map at the bottom. These are the primordial fluctuations of the CMB, with an amplitude of about  $\Delta T/T\sim2\times10^{-5}$. Credit: COBE/DRM team, NASA. Figure taken from Schneider (2006).}}
    \label{fig:cmbcobe}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/CMBCOBE.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The CMB anisotropies depend on nearly all cosmological parameters, such as $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Omega_\mathrm{HDM}$, $H_0$, the normalization $\sigma_8$, the primordial slope $n_s$, and the shape parameter $\Gamma$ of the power spectrum. Therefore, from an accurate mapping of the angular distribution of the CMB and by comparison with theoretical expectations, all these parameters can, in principle, be determined.

{\noindent}Temperature fluctuations originating at the time of last scattering are called primary anisotropies. Later, as the CMB photons propagate through the Universe, they may experience a number of distortions along their way which, again, may change their temperature distribution on the sky. These effects then lead to secondary anisotropies.

{\noindent}Given that the amplitude of the polarization is so small the question of foregrounds is even more important than for the temperature anisotropy. Unfortunately, the level and structure of the various foreground polarization in the CMB frequency bands is currently not well known. Atmospheric emission is believed to be negligibly polarized, leaving the main astrophysical foregrounds: free-free, synchrotron, dust, and point source emissions. Of these the most important foreground is synchrotron emission.

{\noindent}Free-free emission (bremsstrahlung) is intrinsically unpolarized but can be partially polarized by Thomson scattering within the HII region. This small effect is not expected to polarize the emission by more than 10\%. The emission is larger at low frequencies but is not expected to dominate the polarization at any frequency.

{\noindent}The polarization of dust is not well known. In principle, emission from dust particles could be highly polarized, however it's been found that that the majority of dust is polarized at the $\approx2\%$ level at $100\mu{\rm m}$ with a small fraction of regions approaching 10\% polarization. It's also been shown that even at 100\% polarization, extrapolation of the IRAS $100\mu{\rm m}$ map with the COBE FIRAS index shows that dust emission is negligible below $80\,{\rm GHz}$. At higher frequencies it will become the dominant foreground.

{\noindent}Radio point sources are polarized due to synchrotron emission at $<20\%$ level. For large angle experiments, the random contribution from point sources will contribute negligibly, but may be of more concern for the upcoming satellite missions.

{\noindent}Galactic synchrotron emission is the major concern. It is potentially highly polarized with the fraction dependent on the spectral index and depolarization from Faraday rotation and non-uniform magnetic fields. The level of polarization is expected to lie between 10\%-75\% of a total intensity which itself is approximately $5\,\mu{\rm K}$ at $30\,{\rm GHz}$. This estimate follows from extrapolating measurements at $1411\,{\rm MHz}$ with an index of $T\propto\nu^{-3}$.

{\noindent}Due to their different spectral indices, the minimum in the foreground polarization, like the temperature, lies near $100\,{\rm GHz}$. For full sky measurements, since synchrotron emission is more highly polarized than dust, the optimum frequency at which to measure intrinsic (CMB) polarization is slightly higher than for the anisotropy. Over small regions of the sky where one or the other of the foregrounds is known a priori to be absent the optimum frequency would clearly be different. However as with anisotropy measurements, with multi-frequency coverage, polarized foregrounds can be removed.

{\noindent}It is also interesting to consider whether the spatial as well as frequency signature of the polarization can be used to separate foregrounds. Using angular power spectra for the spatial properties of the foregrounds is a simple generalization of methods already used in anisotropy work. For instance, in the case of synchrotron emission, if the spatial correlation in the polarization follows that of the temperature itself, the relative contamination will decrease on smaller angular scales due to its diffuse nature. Furthermore the peak of the cosmic signal in polarization occurs at even smaller angular scales than for the anisotropy.

{\noindent}Of those that can provide information about the cosmic parameters...

{\noindent}\textbf{The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect}: Electrons in the hot gas of the intracluster medium (ICM) can inverse Compton scatter photons of the CMB. The optical depth and thus the scattering probability for this inverse Compton scattering is relatively low, but the effect is nevertheless observable and, in addition, is of great importance for the analysis of clusters. A photon moving through a cluster of galaxies towards us will change its direction through scattering and thus will not reach us. But since the cosmic background radiation is isotropic, for any CMB photon that is scattered out of the line-of-sight, another photon exists -- statistically -- that is scattered into it, so that the total number of photons reaching us is preserved. However, the energy of the photons changes slightly through scattering by the hot electrons, in a way that they have an (on average) higher frequency after scattering. Hence, by this inverse Compton scattering, energy is on average transferred from the electrons to the photons, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:szeffect}.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}In the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) domain of the CMB spectrum, at wavelengths larger than about $2\,{\rm mm}$, the intensity of the CMB is decreased by the SZ-effect. For the change in specific intensity in the RJ part, one obtains

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\Delta I_\nu^\mathrm{RJ}}{I_\nu^\mathrm{RJ}} = -2y,
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $y$ is the the Compton y-parameter

\begin{align*}
    y = \int\frac{k_BT}{m_ec^2}\sigma_Tn_e\mathrm{d}l ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and $\sigma_T$ is the Compton cross-section for electron scattering

\begin{align*}
    \sigma_T = \frac{8\pi}{3}\left(\frac{e^2}{m_ec^2}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi}{3}e_{e,0}^2 ~ [{\rm m^2}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Obviously, $y$ is proportional to the optical depth with respect to Compton scattering, given as an integral over $n_e\sigma_T$ along the line-of-sight. Furthermore, $y$ is proportional to the gas temperature, because that defines the average energy transfer per scattering event. Overall, $y$ is proportional to the integral over the gas pressure $P D=nk_BT$ along the line-of-sight through the cluster.

{\noindent}The SZ effect affects the temperature distribution of the CMB. Some of the photons propagating along lines-of-sight passing through clusters of galaxies or other regions of dense and hot gas are scattered by the hot electrons, resulting in a temperature change in these directions. We recall that in the direction of clusters the measured intensity of the CMB radiation is reduced at low frequencies, whereas it is increased at high frequencies. Hence, the SZ effect can be identified in the CMB data if measurements are conducted over a sufficiently large frequency range.

{\noindent}The SZE spectral distortion of the CMB expressed as a temperature change $\Delta T_\mathrm{SZE}$ at dimensionless frequency $x\equiv h\nu k_BT_\mathrm{CMB}$ is given by

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\Delta T_\mathrm{SZE}}{T_\mathrm{CMB}} = f(x)y = f(x)\int n_e\frac{k_BT_e}{m_ec^2}\sigma_T \mathrm{d}l ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $y$ is the Compton y-parameter, which for an isothermal cluster equals the optical depth, $\tau_e$, times the fractional energy gain per scattering, $\sigma_T$ is the Thomson cross-section, $n_e$ is the electron number density, $T_e$ is the electron temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m_ec^2$ is the electron rest mass energy, and the integration is along the line of sight. The frequency dependence of the SZE is 

\begin{align*}
    f(x) = x\left(\frac{e^x+1}{e^x-1}\right)(1+\delta_\mathrm{SZE}()bx,T_e) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\delta_\mathrm{SZE}(x,T_e)$ is the relativistic correction to the frequency dependence. Note that $f(x)\rightarrow-2$ in the nonrelativistic and Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) limits.

{\noindent}It is worth noting that $\Delta T_\mathrm{SZE}/T_\mathrm{CMB}$ is independent of redshift. This unique feature of the SZE makes it a potentially powerful tool for investigating the high-redshift Universe.

    \label{fig:szrealistic}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The spectral distortion of the CMB spectrum by the thermal SZE is shown in Figure \ref{fig:szrealistic} (solid line) for a realistic massive cluster ($y=10^{-4}$) in units of intensity (left panel) and RJ brightness temperature (right panel). The RJ brightness is shown because the sensitivity of a radio telescope is calibrated in these units. It is defined simply by $I_\nu=(2k_B\nu^2/c^2)T_\mathrm{RJ}$, where $I_\nu$ is the intensity at frequency $\nu$, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light. The CMB blackbody spectrum, $B_\nu(T_\mathrm{CMB})$, multiplied by $0.0005$ (dotted line) is also shown for comparison. Note that the spectral signature of the thermal effect is distinguished readily from a simple temperature fluctuation of the CMB. The kinetic SZE distortion is shown by the dashed curve. In the nonrelativistic regime it is indistinguishable from a CMB temperature fluctuation.

{\noindent}The most important features of the thermal SZE are that (a) it is a small spectral distortion of the CMB of order $\sim1\,{\rm mK}$, which is proportional to the cluster pressure integrated along the line of sight; (b) it is independent of redshift; (c) it has a unique spectral signature with a decrease in the CMB intensity at frequencies $\lesssim218\,{\rm GHz}$ and an increase at higher frequencies; and (d) the integrated SZE flux is proportional to the temperature-weighted mass (total thermal energy) of the cluster, implying that SZE surveys will have a mass threshold nearly independent of redshift.

{\noindent}\textbf{The kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect}: If the cluster is moving with respect to the CMB rest frame, there will be an additional spectral distortion due to the Doppler effect of the cluster bulk velocity on the scattered CMB photons. If a component of the cluster velocity, $v_\mathrm{pec}$, is projected along the line of sight to the cluster, then the Doppler effect will lead to an observed distortion of the CMB spectrum referred to as the kinetic SZE. In the nonrelativistic limit the spectral signature of the kinetic SZE is a pure thermal distortion of magnitude

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\Delta T_\mathrm{SZ}}{T_\mathrm{CMB}} = -\tau_e \left(\frac{v_\mathrm{pec}}{c}\right) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $v_\mathrm{pec}$ is along the line of sight; i.e., the emergent spectrum is still described completely by a Planck spectrum, but at a slightly different temperature, lower (higher) for positive (negative) peculiar velocities (see Figure \ref{fig:szrealistic}).

{\noindent}The scattering of the CMB photons by the hot intracluster medium (ICM) electrons can result in polarization at levels proportional to powers of ($v_\mathrm{pec}/c$) and $\tau_e$. The largest polarization is expected from the anisotropic optical depth to a given location in the cluster. For example, toward the outskirts of a cluster one expects to see a concentric (radial) pattern of the linear polarization at frequencies at which the thermal SZE is positive (negative). Nonspherical morphology for the electron distributions will lead to considerably complicated polarization patterns. The peak polarization of this signal will be of order $\tau_e$ times the SZE signal (i.e., of order $0.025(k_BT_e/m_ec^2)\tau_e^2$ times the CMB intensity). For a massive cluster with $\tau_e=0.01$, the effect would be at the $0.1\,{\mu K}$ level toward the edge of the cluster. In principle, this effect could be used to measure the optical depth of the cluster and therefore separate $T_e$ and $\tau_e$ from a measurement of the thermal SZE.

{\noindent}It can be shown that polarization of the SZE comes entirely from the quadrupole component of the local radiation field experienced by the scattering electron. In the case above, the quadrupole component at the outskirts of the cluster is caused by the anisotropy in the radiation field in the direction of the cluster center due to the SZE. Sunyaev and Zel'dovich discussed polarization due to the motion of the cluster with respect to the CMB and transverse to our line of sight. In this case, the quadrupole comes from the Doppler shift. They found the largest terms to be of order $0.1\tau_e(v_\mathrm{pec}/c)^2$ and $0.025\tau_e^2(v_\mathrm{pec}/c$) of the CMB intensity. The latter term, second order in $\tau_e$, can be thought of as imperfect cancellation of the dipole term due to the anisotropic optical depth. Using $\tau_e=0.01$ and a bulk motion of $500\,{\rm km\,s-1}$ results in polarization levels of order $10\,{\mu K}$, far beyond the sensitivity of current instrumentation.

{\noindent}The CMB as seen by the cluster electrons will have a quadrupole component and therefore the electron scattering will lead to linear polarization. This mechanism could possibly be used to trace the evolution of the CMB quadrupole if polarization measurements could be obtained for a large number of clusters binned in direction and redshift. Sazonov and Sunyaev calculated the expected polarization level and found that the maximum CMB quadrupole-induced polarization is $50(\tau_e/0.01)\,{\rm \mu K}$, somewhat higher than the expected velocity-induced terms discussed above. The effect is again too small to expect detection in the near future. However, by averaging over many clusters, detecting this polarization might be possible with future satellite missions.

{\noindent}\textbf{The integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect}: Inhomogeneities in the gravitational potential cause photons which originate in regions of higher density to climb out of a potential well. As a result of this, they lose energy and are redshifted (gravitational redshift). This effect is partly compensated for by the fact that, besides the gravitational redshift, a gravitational time delay also occurs: a photon that originates in an overdense region will be scattered at a slightly earlier time, and thus at a slightly higher temperature of the Universe, compared to a photon from a region of average density. Both effects always occur side by side. They are combined under the term Sachs-Wolfe effect. Its separation into two processes is necessary only in a simplified description; a general relativistic treatment of the Sachs-Wolfe effect jointly yields both processes.

Describe cosmological inflation. List at least three important observations it is intended to explain.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Inflation can most generally be defined as a period of exponential expansion of the form

    a(t) \propto e^{Ht} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}in the very early on in the Universe. Inflation is intended to explain:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The flatness problem}. This can be states as ``The Universe is nearly flat today, and was even flatter in the past.'' 
    \item \textbf{The horizon problem}. This can be states as ``The Universe is nearly isotropic and homogeneous today, and was even more so in the past.''
    \item \textbf{The magnetic monopole problem}. This can be states as ``The Universe is apparently free of magnetic monopoles''
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}Inflation explains these puzzling aspects of our Universe, by flattening it, ensuring its homogeneity over large scales, and driving down the number density of magnetic monopoles which it contains. At present, there is not a consensus among cosmologists about the exact mechanism driving inflation.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

In the inflationary scenario it is presumed that at very early times the vacuum energy density was much higher than today, so that it dominated the Hubble expansion. Then $\dot{a}/a\approx\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$. This implies an exponential expansion of the Universe,

\begin{align*}
    a(t) \propto e^{Ht} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Obviously, this exponential expansion (or inflationary phase) cannot last forever. We assume that a phase transition took place in which the vacuum energy density is transformed into normal matter and radiation (a process called reheating), which ends the exponential expansion and after which the normal Friedmann evolution of the Universe begins.

{\noindent}At present, there is not a consensus among cosmologists about the exact mechanism driving inflation; there is no known scalar field which can drive inflation. (A skeptic might point out that there is no known fundamental scalar held at all!) Therefore, it may well be true that the idea of inflation is correct but it is driven by something other than a scalar field. Having said that, there are a number of reasons to work with scalar fields, as we will do whenever we need to specify the source of inflation. Almost all fundamental particle physics theories contain scalar fields. In fact, historically it was particle physicists studying high-energy extensions of the Standard Model (in particular GUTs) who proposed the idea of inflation driven by a scalar field as a natural byproduct of some of these extensions. Indeed, almost all current work on inflation is based on a scalar field (or sometimes two). The alternative from a particle physics point of view is to use a vector field (such as the electromagnetic potential) or a set of fermions (similar to the way condensates induce superconductivity) to drive inflation. Neither of these choices works very well, but they both complicate things severely, so we will stick to a scalar field.

{\noindent}\textbf{The horizon problem}: Since no signal can travel faster than light, the existence of a horizon length means that CMB radiation from two directions separated by more than about one degree originates in regions that were not in causal contact before recombination, (i.e., the time when the CMB photons interacted with matter the last time). Therefore, these two regions have never been able to exchange information, for example about their temperature. Nevertheless their temperature is the same, as seen from the high degree of isotropy of the CMB, which shows relative fluctuations of only $\Delta T/T10^{-5}$!

{\noindent}During inflation, $H(a)=\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$ is constant so that the integral for the comoving horizon length formally diverges. This implies that the horizon may become arbitrarily large in the inflationary phase, depending on the duration of the exponential expansion. For illustration we consider a very small region in space of size $L<ct_i$ at a time $t_i\sim10^{-34}\,{\rm s}$ prior to inflation which is in causal contact. Through inflation, it expands tremendously, e.g., by a factor $10^{40}$; the original $L\sim10^{-24}\,{\rm cm}$ inflates to about $10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$ by the end of the inflationary phase, at $t_f\sim10^{-32}{\rm s}$. By today, this spatial region will have expanded by another factor of $10^{25}$ by following (for $t>t_f$) the normal cosmic expansion, to   $10^{41}\,{\rm cm}$. This scale is considerably larger than the size of the currently visible Universe, $c/H_0$. According to this scenario, the whole Universe visible today was in causal contact prior to inflation, so that the homogeneity of the physical conditions at recombination, and with it the nearly perfect isotropy of the CMB, is provided by causal processes.

{\noindent}\textbf{The flatness problem}: For the total density parameter to be of order unity today, it must have been extremely close to $1$ at earlier times, which means that a very precise `fine tuning' of this parameter was necessary.

{\noindent}\textbf{The monopole problem}: The monopole problem -- that is, the apparent lack of magnetic monopoles in the Universe -- is not a purely cosmological problem, but one that results from combining the Hot Big Bang scenario with the particle physics concept of a Grand Unified Theory. In particle physics, a Grand Unified Theory, or GUT, is a field theory which attempts to unify the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Unification of forces has been a goal of scientists since the 1870s, when James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electricity and magnetism are both manifestations of a single underlying electromagnetic field. Currently, it is customary to speak of the four fundamental forces of nature: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong. In the view of many physicists, though, four forces are three too many; they've spent much time and effort to show that two or more of the ``fundamental forces'' are actually different aspects of a single underlying force. About a century after Maxwell, Steven Weinberg, Abdus Salam, and Sheldon Glashow successfully devised an electroweak theory. They demonstrated that at particle energies greater than $E\sim1\,{\rm TeV}$, the electromagnetic force and the weak force unite to form a single ``electroweak'' force. The electroweak energy of $E_\mathrm{ew}\sim1\,{\rm TeV}$ corresponds to a temperature $T_\mathrm{ew}\sim E_\mathrm{ew}/k_B\sim10^{16}\,{\rm K}$; the Universe had this temperature when its age was $t_\mathrm{ew}\sim10^{-12}\,{\rm s}$. Thus, when the Universe was less than a picosecond old, there were only three fundamental forces: the gravitational, strong, and electroweak force. When the predictions of the electroweak energy were confirmed experimentally, Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow toted home their Nobel Prizes, and physicists braced themselves for the next step: unifying the electroweak force with the strong force.

{\noindent}By extrapolating the known properties of the strong and electroweak forces to higher particle energies, physicists estimate that at an energy $E_\mathrm{GUT}$ of roughly $10^{12}-10^{13}\,{\rm TeV}$, the strong and electroweak forces should be unified as a single Grand Unified Force. If the GUT energy is $E_\mathrm{GUT}\sim10^{12}\,{\rm TeV}$, this corresponds to a temperature $T_\mathrm{GUT}\sim10^{28}\,{\rm K}$ and an age for the Universe of $t_\mathrm{GUT}\sim10^{-36}\,{\rm s}$. The GUT energy is about four orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck energy, $E_\mathrm{P}\sim10^{16}\,{\rm TeV}$. Physicists are searching for a Theory of Everything (TOE) which describes how the Grand Unified Force and the force of gravity ultimately unite to form a single unified force at the Planck scale. The different unification energy scales, and the corresponding temperatures and times in the early Universe, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gut}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

{\noindent}One of the predictions of GUT is that the Universe underwent a phase transition as the temperature dropped below the GUT temperature. Generally speaking, phase transitions are associated with a spontaneous loss of symmetry as the temperature of a system is lowered. Take, as an example, the phase transition known as ``freezing water''. At temperatures $T>273\,{\rm K}$, water is liquid. Individual water molecules are randomly oriented, and the liquid water thus has rotational symmetry about any point; in other words, it is isotropic. However, when the temperature drops below $T=273\,{\rm K}$, the water undergoes a phase transition, from liquid to solid, and the rotational symmetry of the water is lost. The water molecules are locked into a crystalline structure, and the ice no longer has rotational symmetry about an arbitrary point. In other words, the ice crystal is anisotropic, with preferred directions corresponding to the crystal’s axes of symmetry. In a broadly similar vein, there is a loss of symmetry when the Universe undergoes the GUT phase transition at $t_\mathrm{GUT}\sim10^{-36}\,{\rm s}$. At $T>T_\mathrm{GUT}$, there was a symmetry between the strong and electroweak forces. At $T<T_\mathrm{GUT}$, the symmetry is spontaneously lost; the strong and electroweak forces begin to behave quite differently from each other.

{\noindent}In general, phase transitions associated with a loss of symmetry give rise to flaws known as topological defects. To see how topological defects form, consider a large tub of water which is cooled below $T=273\,{\rm K}$. Usually, the freezing of the water will start at two or more widely separated nucleation sites. The crystal which forms about any given nucleation site is very regular, with well-defined axes of symmetry. However, the axes of symmetry of two adjacent ice crystals will be misaligned. At the boundary of two adjacent crystals, there will be a two-dimensional topological defect, called a domain wall, where the axes of symmetry fail to line up. Other types of phase transitions give rise to one-dimensional, or line-like, topological defects (in a cosmological context, these linear defects are known as cosmic strings). Still other types of phase transitions give rise to zero-dimensional, or point-like, topological defects. GUT predict that the GUT phase transition creates point-like topological defects which act as magnetic monopoles. That is, they act as the isolated north pole or south pole of a magnet. The rest energy of the magnetic monopoles created in the GUT phase transition is predicted to be $m_Mc^2\sim E_\mathrm{GUT}\sim10^{12}\,{\rm TeV}$. This corresponds to a mass of over a nanogram (comparable to that of a bacterium), which is a lot of mass for a single particle to be carrying around. At the time of the GUT phase transition, points further apart than the horizon size will be out of causal contact with each other. Thus, we expect roughly one topological defect per horizon volume, due to the mismatch of fields which are not causally linked. The number density of magnetic monopoles, at the time of their creation, would be

\begin{align*}
    n_M(t_\mathrm{GUT}) \sim \frac{1}{(2ct_\mathrm{GUT})^3} \sim 10^{82} ~ [{\rm m^{-3}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and their energy density would be

\begin{align*}
    (m_Mc^2)n_M \sim 10^{94}\,{[\rm TeV\,m^{-3}]}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This is a large energy density, but it is smaller by ten orders of magnitude than the energy density of radiation at the time of the GUT phase transition:

\begin{align*}
    \alpha T_\mathrm{GUT}^4 \sim 10^{104}\,{[\rm TeV\,m^{-3}]}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Thus, the magnetic monopoles wouldn't have kept the Universe from being radiation-dominated at the time of the GUT phase transition. However, the magnetic monopoles, being so massive, would soon have become highly non-relativistic, with energy density $\propto a^{-3}$. The energy density in radiation, though, was falling off at the rate $\propto a^{-4}$. Thus, the magnetic monopoles would have dominated the energy density of the Universe when the scale factor had grown by a factor $\sim10^{10}$; that is, when the temperature had fallen to $T\sim10^{-10}\,T_\mathrm{GUT}\sim10^{18}\,{\rm K}$, and the age of the Universe was only $t\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm s}$.

{\noindent}Obviously, the Universe is not dominated by magnetic monopoles today. In fact, there is no strong evidence that they exist at all. Every north magnetic pole which we can find is paired with a south magnetic pole, and vice versa. There are no isolated north poles or isolated south poles. The monopole problem can thus be rephrased as the question, ``Where have all the magnetic monopoles gone?'' Now, you can always answer the question, ``Where have the monopoles gone?'' by saying, ``There were never any monopoles to begin with''” There is not yet a single, definitive GUT, and in some variants on the GUT theme, magnetic monopoles are not produced. However, the flatness and horizon problems are not so readily dismissed. When the physicist Alan Guth first proposed the idea of inflation in 1981, he introduced it as a way of resolving the flatness problem, the horizon problem, and the monopole problem with a single cosmological mechanism.

\subsection{Question 12}

Define and describe a `fine tuning problem'. How do anthropic arguments attempt to resolve it?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The flatness problem: for the total density parameter to be of order unity today, it must have been extremely close to $1$ at earlier times, which means that a very precise `fine tuning' of this parameter was necessary. By anthropic arguments, we live in a Universe which had, at a very early time, a very precisely tuned density parameter, because only in such a Universe can life evolve and astronomers exist to examine the flatness of the Universe. In all other conceivable Universes this would not be possible. This approach is meaningful only if a large number of Universes existed—in this case we should not be too surprised about living in one of those where this initial fine-tuning took place—in the other ones, we, and the question about the cosmological parameters, would just not exist. This approach is called the \textbf{anthropic principle}.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Let us consider the consequences of the case where $\Omega_0$ had not been so extremely close to $1$ at $z\sim10^{10}$; then, the Universe would have recollapsed long ago, or it would have expanded significantly faster than the Universe we live in. In either case, the consequences for the evolution of life in the Universe would have been catastrophic. In the first case, the total lifetime of the Universe would have been much shorter than is needed for the formation of the first stars and the first planetary systems, so that in such a world no life could be formed. In the second case, extreme expansion would have prevented the formation of structure in the Universe. In such a Universe no life could have evolved either. 

{\noindent}This consideration can be interpreted as follows: we live in a Universe which had, at a very early time, a very precisely tuned density parameter, because only in such a Universe can life evolve and astronomers exist to examine the flatness of the Universe. In all other conceivable Universes this would not be possible. This approach is meaningful only if a large number of Universes existed (in this case we should not be too surprised about living in one of those where this initial fine-tuning took place) in the other ones, we, and the question about the cosmological parameters, would just not exist. This approach is called the anthropic principle. It may either be seen as an `explanation' for the flatness of our Universe, or as a capitulation -- where we give up to explore a physical reason for the origin of the flatness of our Universe.

\subsubsection{Follow-up Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are other fine tuning problems? (Note: if you talk about $\Omega_k$, you cannot talk about $\Omega_\Lambda$ since they are related.)
    \item How do you \textit{feel} about the anthropic principle?
    \item Is the anthropic principle a scientifically or logically sound argument?
    \item What is the weak versus strong anthropic principle?

\subsection{Question 13}

Define the two-point correlation function. How is it related to the power spectrum? How is the $C_\ell$ spectrum of the CMB related to low redshift galaxy clustering?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The \textbf{two-point correlation function} is given by

\begin{align*}
    \xi_g(r) = \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{-\gamma} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $r_0\sim5\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ denotes the correlation length, and the slope is about $\gamma\simeq1.7$. It is related to the \textbf{power spectrum} $P(k)$ via the Fourier transform

\begin{align*}
    P(k) = 2\pi \int\limits_0^\infty x^2\frac{\sin(kx)}{kx}\xi(x)\mathrm{d}x ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Galaxies are not randomly distributed in space, but rather they gather in groups, clusters, or even larger structures. Phrased differently, this means that the probability of finding a galaxy at location x is not independent of whether there is a galaxy at a neighboring point y. It is more probable to find a galaxy in the vicinity of another one than at an arbitrary location. This phenomenon is described such that one considers two points $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, and two volume elements $\mathrm{d}V$ around these points. If $\bar{n}$ is the average number density of galaxies, the probability of finding a galaxy in the volume element $\mathrm{d}V$ around $x$ is then

\begin{align*}
    P_1 = \bar{n}\mathrm{d}V ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}independent of $\mathbf{x}$ if we assume that the Universe is statistically homogeneous. We choose $\mathrm{d}V$ such that $P_1\ll1$, so that the probability of finding two or more galaxies in this volume element is negligible.

{\noindent}The probability of finding a galaxy in the volume element $\mathrm{d}V$ at location $\mathbf{x}$ and at the same time finding a galaxy in the volume element $\mathrm{d}V$ at location $\mathbf{y}$ is then

\begin{align*}
    P_2 = (\bar{n}\mathrm{d}V)^2 [1+\xi_g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})] ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If the distribution of galaxies was uncorrelated, the probability $P_2$ would simply be the product of the probabilities of finding a galaxy at each of the locations $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ in a volume element $\mathrm{d}V$, so $P_2=P_1^2$. But since the distribution is correlated, the relation does not apply in this simple form; rather, it needs to be modified, as was done. This equation defines the \textbf{two-point correlation function} (or simply `\textbf{correlation function}') of galaxies $\xi_g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$.

{\noindent}By analogy to this, the correlation function for the total matter density can be defined as

\begin{align*}
    \langle\rho(\mathbf{x})\rho(\mathbf{y})\rangle &= \bar{\rho}^2\langle[1+\delta(\mathbf{x})][1+\delta(\mathbf{y})]\rangle \\
    &= \bar{\rho}^2 (1+\delta(\mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{y})) \\
    &= \bar{\rho}^2(1+\xi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}because the mean (or expectation) value $\langle\delta(\mathbf{x})\rangle$ for all locations $\mathbf{x}$.

{\noindent}In the above equations, angular brackets denote averaging over an ensemble of distributions that all have identical statistical properties. In our example of the lake, the correlation function of the wave amplitudes at positions $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, for instance, would be determined by taking a large number of snapshots of its surface and then averaging the product of the amplitudes at these two locations over all these realizations.

{\noindent}Since the Universe is considered statistically homogeneous, $\xi$ can only depend on the difference $\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}$ and not on $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ individually. Furthermore, $\xi$ can only depend on the separation $r=\lvert\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\rvert$, and not on the direction of the separation vector $\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}$ because of the assumed statistical isotropy of the Universe. Therefore, $\xi=\xi(r)$ is simply a function of the separation between two points.

{\noindent}For a homogeneous random field, the ensemble average can be replaced by spatial averaging (i.e., the correlation function can be determined by averaging over the products of densities at pairs of points) for a large number of pairs of points with given separation $r$. For determining the correlation function of galaxies, we note that $\xi_g(r)$ is the excess probability to find a galaxy at a separation $r$ from another galaxy, relative to that of a random distribution. Therefore, $\xi_g(r)$ can be determined by first counting the number of galaxy pairs with separation in the interval $\Delta r$ around $r$. Then one creates a random distribution of the same number of objects in the same volume, and again counts the pairs in the same distance interval. The ratio of these two pair counts then yields an estimate for $\xi_g(r)$.

{\noindent}The equivalence of ensemble average and spatial average is called the ergodicity of the random field. Only by this can the correlation function (and all other statistical properties) in our Universe be measured at all, because we are able to observe only a single (namely our) realization of the hypothetical ensemble. From the measured correlations between galaxy positions, as determined from spectroscopic redshift surveys of galaxies, one finds the approximate relation

\begin{align*}
    \xi_g(r) = \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{-\gamma} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}for galaxies of luminosity $\sim L^*$, where $r_0\sim5\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ denotes the correlation length, and where the slope is about $\gamma\simeq1.7$. This relation is approximately valid over a range of separations $0.2h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}\lesssim r \lesssim 30h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$.

{\noindent}Hence, the correlation function provides a means to characterize the structure of the cosmological matter distribution. Besides this two-point correlation function, correlations of higher order may also be defined, leading to general n-point correlation functions. These are more difficult to determine from observation, though. It can be shown that the statistical properties of a random field are fully specified by the set of all n-point correlations.

{\noindent}An alternative (and equivalent) description of the statistical properties of a random field, and thus of the matter distribution in a Universe, is the power spectrum $P(k)$. Roughly speaking, the power spectrum $P(k)$ describes the level of structure as a function of the length-scale $L\simeq2\pi/k$; the larger $P(k)$, the larger the amplitude of the fluctuations on a length-scale $2\pi/k$. Here, $k$ is a comoving wave number. Phrased differently, the density fluctuations are decomposed into a sum of plane waves of the form $\delta(\mathbf{x})=\sum a_k\cos(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{k})$, with a wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ and an amplitude $a_k$. The power spectrum $P(k)$ then describes the mean of the squares, $\lvert a_k\rvert^2$, of the amplitudes, averaged over all wave vectors with equal length $k=\lvert\mathbf{k}\lvert$. Technically speaking, this is a Fourier decomposition. Referring back to the example of waves on the surface of a lake, one finds that a characteristic wavelength $L_c$ exists, which depends, among other factors, on the wind speed. In this case, the power spectrum will have a prominent maximum at $k=2\pi/L_c$.

{\noindent}The power spectrum $P(k)$ and the correlation function are related through a Fourier transform; formally, one has

\begin{align*}
    P(k) = 2\pi \int\limits_0^\infty x^2\frac{\sin(kx)}{kx}\xi(x)\mathrm{d}x ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}i.e., the integral over the correlation function with a weight factor depending on $k\sim2\pi/L$. This relation can also be inverted, and thus $\xi(x)$ can be computed from $P(k)$.

{\noindent}Since the CMB temperature fluctuations $\delta T/T$ is defined on the surface of a sphere -- the celestial sphere, in this case -- it is useful to expand it in spherical harmonics:

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\delta T}{T}(\theta,\phi) = \sum\limits_{\ell=0}^{\infty}\sum\limits_{m=-1}^{\ell} a_{\ell m}Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ are the usual \textbf{spherical harmonic functions}\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table\_of\_spherical\_harmonics}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table\_of\_spherical\_harmonics}}. What concerns cosmologists is not the exact pattern of hot spots and cold spots on the sky, but their statistical properties. The most important statistical property of $\delta T/T$ is the correlation function $C(\theta)$. Consider two points on the last scattering surface. Relative to an observer, they are in the directions $\hat{n}$ and $\hat{n}'$, and are separated by an angle $\theta$ given by the relation $cos\theta=\hat{n}\cdot\hat{n}'$. To find the correlation function $C(\theta)$, multiply together the values of $\delta T/T$ at the two points, then average the product over all points separated by the angle $\theta$:

\begin{align*}
    C(\theta) = \left\langle\frac{\delta T}{T}(\hat{n})\frac{\delta T}{T}(\hat{n}')\right\rangle_{\hat{n}\cdot\hat{n}'=\cos\theta}
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If cosmologists knew the precise value of $C(\theta)$ for all angles from $\theta=0$ to $\theta=180^\circ$, they would have a complete statistical description of the temperature fluctuations over all angular scales. Unfortunately, the CMB measurements which tell us about $C(\theta)$ contain information over only a limited range of angular scales.

{\noindent}The limited angular resolution of available observations is what makes the spherical harmonic expansion of $\delta T/T$ so useful. Using the expansion of $\delta T/T$ in spherical harmonics, the correlation function can be written in the form

\begin{align*}
    C(\theta) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \sum\limits_{\ell=0}^\infty (2\ell+\ell)(C_\ell)P_\ell(cos\theta),
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $P_\ell$ are the usual \textbf{Legendre polynomials}:

\begin{align*}
    P_0(x) = 1 \\
    P_1(x) = x \\
    P_2(x) = \frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and so forth. In this way, a measured correlation function $C(\theta)$ can be broken down into its multipole moments $C_\ell$.

{\noindent}Generally speaking, a term $C_\ell$ is a measure of temperature fluctuations on the angular scale $\theta\sim180^\circ/\ell$. Thus, the multipole $\ell$ is interchangeable, for all practical purposes, with the angular scale $\theta$. The $\ell=0$ (monopole) term of the correlation function vanishes if you've defined the mean temperature correctly. The $\ell=1$ (dipole) term results primarily from the Doppler shift due to our motion through space. It is the moments with $\ell\geq2$ which are of the most interest to cosmologists, since they tell us about the fluctuations present at the time of last scattering.

{\noindent}In presenting the results of CMB observations, it is customary to plot the function

\begin{align*}
    \Delta T \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}}\langle T \rangle ~ [{\rm K}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}since this function tells us the contribution per logarithmic interval in $\ell$ to the total temperature fluctuation $\delta T$ of the CMB. The detailed shape of the $\Delta T$ versus $\ell$ curve contains a wealth of information about the Universe at the time of photon decoupling. 

{\noindent}At the time of last scattering, a particularly interesting length scale, cosmologically speaking, is the Hubble distance,

\begin{align*}
    d_H = \frac{c}{H(z_\mathrm{ls})} \approx \frac{3\times10^8\,{\rm m\,s^{-1}}}{1.24\times10^{-18}\,s^{-1}(1101)^{3/2}} \approx 6.6\times10^{21}\,{\rm m} \approx 0.2\,{[\rm Mpc]},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the redshift of last scattering is $z_\mathrm{ls}\approx1100$. A patch of the last scattering surface with this physical size will have an angular size, as seen from Earth, of

\begin{align*}
    \theta_H = \frac{c/H(z_\mathrm{ls})}{d_A} \approx \frac{0.2\,{\rm Mpc}}{13\,{\rm Mpc}} \approx 0.015\,{\rm rad} \approx 1^\circ.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}It is no coincidence that the peak in the $\Delta T$ versus $\ell$ curve occurs at an angular scale $θ\sim\theta_H$. The origin of temperature fluctuations with $\theta>\theta_H$ ($\ell<180$) is different from those with $\theta<\theta_H$ ($\ell>180$).

\subsection{Question 14}

Consider a cosmological model including a positive cosmological constant. Show that, in such a model, the expansion factor eventually expands at an exponential rate. Sketch the time dependence of the expansion factor in the currently favoured cosmological model.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

{\noindent}Friedmann equation can be written in terms of $\Omega_{r,0}$, $\Omega_{m,0}$, and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$ via

\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{H}{H_0}\right)^2 = \frac{\Omega_{r,0}}{a^4} + \frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{a^3} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0} + \frac{1-\Omega_0}{a^2}
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\Omega_0=\Omega_{r,0}+\Omega_{m,0}+\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$. Since $(H/H_0)^2=(\dot{a}/a)^2$, this can be re-written as

\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\right)^2 &= \frac{\Omega_{r,0}}{a^4} + \frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{a^3} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0} + \frac{1-\Omega_0}{a^2} \\
    \dot{a}(t) &= a(t)\sqrt{\frac{\Omega_{r,0}}{a^4} + \frac{\Omega_{m,0}}{a^3} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0} + \frac{1-\Omega_0}{a^2}}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}For $a\gg1$, this simplifies to

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}a}{\mathrm{d}t} &\approx a(t)\sqrt{\Omega_{\Lambda,0}} \\
    a(t) &\approx e^{\sqrt{\Omega_{\Lambda,0}}t}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Therefore, at large scale factors, the expansion proceeds at the exponential rate as follows:

\begin{align*}
    a(t) \propto e^{\sqrt{\Omega_{\Lambda,0}}t}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}The Benchmark Model, is adopted as the best fit to the currently available observational data, is spatially flat, and contains radiation, matter, and a cosmological constant. The Hubble constant of the Benchmark Model is assumed to be $H_0=70\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. The radiation in the Benchmark Model consists of photons and neutrinos. The photons are assumed to be provided solely by a CMB with current temperature $T_0=2.725\,{\rm K}$ and density parameter $\Omega_{\gamma,0}=5.0\times10^{-5}$. The energy density of the CNB is theoretically calculated to be 68\% of that of the CMB, as long as neutrinos are relativistic. If a neutrino has a non-zero mass $m_\nu$, it defects from the ``radiation'' column to the ``matter'' column when the scale factor is $a\sim5\times10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}/(m_\nu c^2)$. The matter content of the Benchmark Model consists partly of baryonic matter (that is, matter composed of protons and neutrons, with associated electrons), and partly of nonbaryonic dark matter; the evidence indicates that most of the matter in the Universe is nonbaryonic dark matter. The baryonic material that we are familiar with from our everyday existence has a density parameter of $\Omega_{b,0}\approx0.04$ today. The density parameter of the nonbaryonic dark matter is roughly six times greater: $\Omega_{c,0}\approx0.26$. The bulk of the energy density in the Benchmark Model, however, is not provided by radiation or matter, but by a cosmological constant, with $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}=1-\Omega_{m,0}-\Omega_{r,0}\approx0.70$.

{\noindent}The Benchmark Model was first radiation-dominated, then matter-dominated, and is now entering into its lambda-dominated phase. Radiation gave way to matter at a scale factor $a_{rm}=\Omega_{r,0}/\Omega{m,0}=2.8\times10^{-4}$, corresponding to a time $t_{rm}=4.7\times10^4\,{\rm yr}$. Matter, in turn, gave way to the cosmological constant at $a_{m\Lambda}=(\Omega_{m,0}/\Omega_{\Lambda,0})^{1/3}$ corresponding to $t_{m\Lambda}=9.8\,{\rm Gyr}$. The current age of the Universe, in the Benchmark Model, is $t_0=13.5\,{\rm Gyr}$.

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:avst} shows the scale factor, thus computed, for the Benchmark Model. Note that the transition from the $a\propto t^{1/2}$ radiation-dominated phase to the $a\propto t^{2/3}$ matter-dominated phase is not an abrupt one; neither is the later transition from the matter-dominated phase to the exponentially growing lambda-dominated phase. One curious feature of the Benchmark Model which Figure \ref{fig:avst} illustrates vividly is that we are living very close to the time of matter-lambda equality.

\subsection{Question 15}

Define and describe the epoch of reionization. What are the observational constraints on it?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

After recombination occurring at a redshift $z\sim1,100$, the Universe entered the cosmic \textit{Dark Ages} where it became predominantly neutral until $z\sim16$. Around this time, gravitational Jeans instabilities allowed for the formation of the first generation of stars. While they have yet to be directly observed, these Population III (Pop III) stars were particular massive ($\sim100\,M_\odot$), implying that they were extremely hot and capable of radiating significant amounts of ionizing UV photons. These Pop III stars triggered a significant phase transition in the IGM as they began ionizing the predominantly neutral gas during a time called the \textit{Epoch of Reionization} (EoR). There are several observational constraints on this period, including Ly$\alpha$ forest lines, Gunn-Peterson absorption, and CMB polarization.


\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}The baryonic pre-galactic medium (PGM) evolves in three distinct phases. At high redshifts ($z>1100$) the PGM is hot, fully ionized, and optically thick to \textbf{Thomson scattering}, and hence coupled to the photon field. As the Universe expands, the PGM cools, and eventually recombines, leaving a surface of last scattering (the CMB), plus a neutral PGM. This neutral phase lasts from $z=1100$ to $z\sim14$. At some point between $z\sim14$ and $6$, hydrogen in the PGM is ``reionized,'' due to UV radiation from the first luminous objects, leaving the fully reionized IGM seen during the ``realm of the galaxies'' ($0<z<6$). The ionized, dense PGM at very high redshift has been well studied through extensive observations of the CMB. Likewise, the reionized, rarified IGM at low redshift has been well characterized through QSO absorption line studies. The middle phase (the existence of a neutral IGM during the so-called dark ages and the process of reionization of this medium) is the last directly observable phase of cosmic evolution that remains to be verified and explored. The epoch of reionization (EoR) is crucial in cosmic structure formation studies, because it sets a fundamental benchmark indicating the formation of the first luminous objects, either star-forming galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGN).

{\noindent}After recombination at $z\sim1100$, the intergalactic gas became neutral, with a residual ionization fraction of only $10^{-4}$. Had the Universe remained neutral we would not be able to receive any photons that were emitted bluewards of the Ly$\alpha$ line of a source, because the absorption cross section for Ly$\alpha$ photons is too large. Since such photons are observed from QSOs, as can be seen for instance in the spectra of the $z>5.7$ QSOs in Figure \ref{fig:qsoabsorption}, and since an appreciable fraction of homogeneously distributed neutral gas in the intergalactic medium can be excluded for $z\gtrsim5$, from the tight upper bounds on the strength of the Gunn-Peterson effect, the Universe must have been reionized between the recombination epoch and the redshift $z\sim7$ of the most distant known QSOs.

{\noindent}This raises the question of how this reionization proceeded, in particular which process was responsible for it. The latter question is easy to answer -- reionization must have happened by photoionization. Collisional ionization can be ruled out because for it to be efficient the intergalactic medium (IGM) would need to be very hot, a scenario which can be excluded due to the perfect Planck spectrum of the CMB. Hence, the next question is what produced the energetic photons that caused the photoionization of the IGM.

{\noindent}Two kinds of sources may in principle account for them -- hot stars or AGNs. Currently, it is not unambiguously clear which of these is the predominant source of energetic photons causing reionization since our current understanding of the formation of supermassive black holes is still insufficient. However, it is currently thought that the main source of photoionization photons is the first generation of hot stars.

{\noindent}Following on from the above arguments, understanding reionization is thus directly linked to studying the first generation of stars. In the present Universe star formation occurs in galaxies; thus, one needs to examine when the first galaxies could have formed. From the theory of structure formation, the mass spectrum of dark matter halos at a given redshift can be computed by means of, e.g., the Press-Schechter model. Two conditions need to be fulfilled for stars to form in these halos. First, gas needs to be able to fall into the dark halos. Since the gas has a finite temperature, pressure forces may impede the infall into the potential well. Second, this gas also needs to be able to cool, condensing into clouds in which stars can then be formed.

{\noindent}By means of a simple argument, we can estimate under which conditions pressure forces are unable to prevent the infall of gas into a potential well. To do this, we consider a slightly overdense spherical region of radius $R$ whose density is only a little larger than the mean cosmic matter density $\bar{\rho}$. If this sphere is homogeneously filled with baryons, the gravitational binding energy of the gas is about

\begin{align*}
    \lvert E_\mathrm{pot} \rvert \sim \frac{GMM_g}{R} ~ [{\rm J}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $M$ and $M_g$ denote the total mass and the gas mass of the sphere, respectively. The thermal energy of the gas can be computed from the kinetic energy per particle, multiplied by the number of particles in the gas, or

\begin{align*}
    E_\mathrm{th} &\sim c_s^2M_g ~ [{\rm J}],    
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the sound speed is given by

\begin{align*}
    c_s \approx \sqrt{\frac{k_BT}{\mu m}} ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}]
\end{align*}

The positions of the most important emission lines are marked. Particularly remarkable is the almost complete lack of flux bluewards of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line in some of the QSOs, indicating a strong Gunn-Peterson effect. However, this absorption is not complete in all QSOs, which points at strong variations in the density of neutral hydrogen in the IGM at these high redshifts. Either the hydrogen density varies strongly for different lines-of-sight, or the degree of ionization is very inhomogeneous. Source: X.

{\noindent}which is about the average velocity of the gas particles, and $m$ denotes the average particle mass in the gas. For the gas to be bound in the gravitational field, its gravitational binding energy needs to be larger than its thermal energy, $E_\mathrm{pot}>E_\mathrm{th}$, which yields the condition $GM>c_s^2R$. Since we have assumed an only slightly overdense region, the relation $M\sim\bar{\rho}R^3$ between mass and radius of the sphere applies. From the two latter equations, the radius can be eliminated, yielding the condition

\begin{align*}
    M > M_J \equiv \frac{\pi^{5/2}}{6}\left(\frac{c_s^2}{G}\right)^{3/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{\rho}}} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $M_J$ is the \textbf{Jeans mass}. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature of the gas, expressed through the sound speed $c_s$, and on the mean cosmic matter density $\bar{\rho}$. The latter can easily be expressed as a function of redshift, $\bar{\rho}(z) = \bar{\rho}_0(1+z)^3$.

{\noindent}The baryon temperature $T_b$ has a more complicated dependence on redshift. For sufficiently high redshifts, the small fraction of free electrons that remains after recombination provides a thermal coupling of the baryons to the cosmic background radiation, by means of Compton scattering. This is the case for redshifts $z>z_t$, where

\begin{align*}
    z_t \approx 140\left(\frac{\Omega_bh^2}{0.022}\right)^{2/5} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}hence, $T_b(z)\approx T(z)=T_0(1+z)$ for $z>z_t$. For smaller redshifts, the density of photons gets too small to maintain this coupling, and baryons start to adiabatically cool down by the expansion, so that for $z\lesssim zt$ we obtain approximately $T_b\propto\rho_b^{2/3}\propto(1+z)^2$.

{\noindent}From these temperature dependencies, the Jeans mass then be calculated as a function of redshift. For $z_t\gtrsim z\gtrsim 1000$, $M_J$ is independent of $z$ because $c_s
\propto T^{1/2}\propto(1+z)^{1/2}$ and $\bar{\rho}\propto(1+z)^3$ and its value is

\begin{align*}
    M_J = 1.35\times10^5 \left(\frac{\Omega_mh^2}{0.15}\right)^{-1/2} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}whereas for $z\gtrsim z_t$ we obtain, with $T_b\simeq1.7\times10^{-2}(1+z)^2\,{\rm K}$,

\begin{align*}
    M_J = 5.7\times10^3 \left(\frac{\Omega_mh^2}{0.15}\right)^{-1/2} \left(\frac{\Omega_bh^2}{0.022}\right)^{-3/5}\left(\frac{1+z}{10}\right)^{3/2} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Hence, gas can not fall into halos with mass lower than these values.

    {\includegraphics[width=11cm]{figures/cosmology/CoolingFunction.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The Jeans criterion is a necessary condition for the formation of proto-galaxies (i.e., dark matter halos which contain baryons). In order to form stars, the gas in the halos needs to be able to cool further. Here, we are dealing with the particular situation of the first galaxies, whose gas is metal-free, so metal lines cannot contribute to the cooling. The cooling function of primordial gas is much smaller than that of enriched material; in particular, the absence of metals means that even slow cooling though excitation of fine-structure lines cannot occur, as there are no atoms with such transitions present. Thus, cooling by the primordial gas is efficient only above $T\gtrsim2\times10^4\,{\rm K}$. However, the halos formed at high redshift have low mass. The abundance of dark matter halos depends on the parameter $\nu$ which is the ratio between the density threshold required for collapse and the dispersion of fluctuations on a given mass scale. At high redshift, the growth factor $D_+(a)$ is small, and thus to have a noticeable abundance of halos of mass $M$, the dispersion $\sigma(M)$ must be correspondingly large. At redshift $z\sim10$, the parameter $\nu$ is about unity for halos of mass $\sim10^3\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Hence, at that time, substantially more massive halos than that were (exponentially) rare (i.e., only low-mass halos were around) and their virial temperature

\begin{align*}
    T_\mathrm{vir} \approx 2\times10^2 \left(\frac{M}{10^5h^{-1}\,{\rm M_\odot}}\right)^{2/3} \left(\frac{1+z}{10}\right) ~ [{\rm K}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}is considerably below the energy scale where atomic hydrogen can efficiently cool. Here, we used the fact that the mean matter density of a halo inside its virial radius is   200 times the critical density at a given redshift. Therefore, atomic hydrogen is a very inefficient coolant for these first halos, insufficient to initiate the formation of stars. Furthermore, helium is of no help in this context, since its excitation temperature is even higher than that of hydrogen.

    {\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figures/cosmology/CoolingFunctionHydrogen.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Besides atomic hydrogen and helium, the primordial gas contains a small fraction of molecular hydrogen which represents an extremely important component in cooling processes. Whereas in enriched gas, molecular hydrogen is formed on dust particles, the primordial gas had no dust, and so H$_2$ must form in the gas phase itself, rendering its abundance very small. However, despite its very small density and transition probability, H$_2$ dominates the cooling rate of primordial gas at temperatures below $T\sim10^4\,{\rm K}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:coolingfunctionhydrogen}) where the precise value of this temperature depends on the abundance of H$_2$.

{\noindent}By means of H$_2$, the gas can cool in halos with a temperature exceeding about $T_\mathrm{vir}\gtrsim1000\,{\rm K}$, corresponding to a halo mass of $M\gtrsim5\times10^4\,{\rm M_\odot}$ at $z\sim20$. In these halos, stars may then be able to form. These stars will certainly be different from those known to us, because they do not contain any metals. Therefore, the opacity of the stellar plasma is much lower. Such stars, which at the same mass presumably have a much higher temperature and luminosity (and thus a shorter lifetime), are called population III stars. Due to their high temperature they are much more efficient sources of ionizing photons than stars with `normal' metallicity.

{\noindent}The energetic photons from these population III stars are now capable of ionizing hydrogen in their vicinity. More important still is another effect: photons with energy above $11.26eV$ can destroy H$_2$. Since the Universe is transparent for photons with energies below $13.6\,{\rm eV}$, photons with $11.26\,{\rm eV}\geq E \geq 13.6\,{\rm eV}$ can propagate very long distances and dissociate molecular hydrogen. This means that as soon as the first stars have formed in a region of the Universe, molecular hydrogen in their vicinities will be destroyed and further gas cooling and star formation will then be prevented. At this point, the Universe contains a low number density of isolated bubbles of ionized hydrogen, centered on those halos in which population III stars were able to form early, but this constitutes only a tiny fraction of the volume; most of the baryons remain neutral.

{\noindent}Soon after population III stars have formed, they will explode as supernovae. Through this process, the metals produced by them are ejected into the IGM, by which the initial metal enrichment occurs. The kinetic energy transferred by SNe to the gas within the halo can exceed its binding energy, so that the baryons of the halo can be blown away and further star formation is prevented. Whether this effect may indeed lead to gas-free halos, or whether the released energy can instead be radiated away, depends on the geometry of the star-formation regions. In any case, it can be assumed that in those halos where the first generation of stars was born, further star formation was considerably suppressed, particularly since all molecular hydrogen was destroyed.

{\noindent}We can assume that the metals produced in these first SN explosions are, at least partially, ejected from the halos into the IGM, thus enriching the latter. The existence of metal formation in the very early Universe is concluded from the fact that even sources at very high redshift (like QSOs at $z\sim6$) have a metallicity of about one tenth the Solar value. Furthermore, the Ly$\alpha$ forest also contains gas with non-vanishing metallicity. Since the Ly$\alpha$ forest is produced by the IGM, this therefore must have been enriched.

{\noindent}For gas to cool in halos without molecular hydrogen, their virial temperature needs to exceed about $10^4\,{\rm K}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:coolingfunctionhydrogen}). Halos of this virial temperature form with appreciable abundance at redshifts of $z\sim10$, corresponding to a halo mass of $\sim10^7\,{\rm M_\odot}$, as can be estimated from the Press-Schechter model. In these halos, efficient star formation can then take place and the first proto-galaxies form. These then ionize the surrounding IGM in the form of HII-regions, as sketched in Figure \ref{fig:reionization}. The corresponding HII-regions expand because increasingly more photons are produced. If the halo density is sufficiently high, these HII-regions start to overlap and soon after fill the whole volume. Once this occurs, the IGM is ionized, and reionization is completed.

    \caption{\footnotesize{\textit{On the left}, a sketch of the geometry of reionization is shown: initially, relatively low-mass halos collapse, a first generation of stars ionizes and heats the gas in and around these halos. By heating, the temperature increases so strongly (to about $T\sim10^4\,{\rm K}$) that gas can escape from the potential wells; these halos may never again form stars efficiently. Only when more massive halos have collapsed will continuous star formation set in. Ionizing photons from this first generation of hot stars produce HII-regions around their halos, which is the onset of reionization. The regions in which hydrogen is ionized will grow until they start to overlap; at that time, the flux of ionizing photons will strongly increase. \textit{On the right}, the average spectrum of photons at the beginning of the reionization epoch is shown; here, it has been assumed that the flux from the radiation source follows a power law (dashed curve). Photons with an energy higher than that of the Ly$\alpha$ transition are strongly suppressed because they are efficiently absorbed. The spectrum near the Lyman limit shows features which are produced by the combination of breaks corresponding to the various Lyman lines, and the redshifting of the photons. Source: R. Barkana \& A.

    \label{fig:reionization}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}We therefore conclude that reionization is a two-stage process. In a first phase, population III stars form through cooling of gas by molecular hydrogen, which is then destroyed by these very stars. Only in a later epoch and in more massive halos cooling is provided by atomic hydrogen, leading to reionization.

{\noindent}The increase of temperature causes an increase of the Jeans mass, due to its dependence on the sound speed. Once the IGM is heated to $\sim10^4\,{\rm K}$ by intergalactic UV radiation, the gas pressure prevents gas inflow into low-mass halos, corresponding to circular velocities $\lesssim30\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. For this reason, one expects that halos of lower mass have a lower baryon fraction than that of the cosmic mixture, $f_b=\Omega_b/\Omega_m$. The actual value of the baryon fraction depends on the details of the merger history of a halo. Quantitative studies yield an average baryon mass of

\begin{align*}
    \bar{M}_b = \frac{f_b M}{[1+(2^{\alpha/3}-1)(M_C/M)^\alpha]^{3/\alpha}} ~ [{\rm kg}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $M_C\sim10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$ is a characteristic mass, defined such that for a halo with mass $M_C$, $\bar{M}_b/M=f_b/2$. For halos of mass smaller than $M_C$, the baryon fraction is suppressed, decreasing as $(M/M_C)^3$ for small masses, whereas for halo masses $\gg M_C$, the baryon fraction corresponds to the cosmic average. The index $\alpha\sim2$ determines the sharpness of the transition between these two cases. The characteristic mass $M_C$ depends on redshift, being much smaller at high $z$ due to the stronger ionizing background.

{\noindent}The ionizing flux has two additional effects on the gas that resides in halos: it provides a source of heating due to photoionization and it leads to a higher degree of ionization in the gas, reducing the number density of atoms which can be excited by collisions and cool through de-excitation. Both effects act in the same direction, by impeding an efficient cooling of the gas and hence the formation of stars. For halos of larger mass, intergalactic radiation is of fairly little importance because the corresponding heating rate is substantially smaller than that occurring by the dissipation of the gas which is needed to concentrate the baryons towards the halo center. For low-mass halos, however, this effect is important. Together, these two effects reduce the cooling rate of the gas, which is a dominant effect for low-mass halos. Thus, the gas in low-mass halos cannot cool efficiently, suppressing star formation -- unless star formation occurred before the reionization was completed. We hence found one of the elements for the second part of the answer to the question about the different mass-to-light ratios in halos: star formation in low mass halos is strongly suppressed due to the ionizing background radiation. This also provides an explanation of the `missing satellite problem'.

{\noindent}To singly ionize helium, photons of energy $\geq24.6\,{\rm eV}$ are required, and the ionization energy of He II is four times that of hydrogen. In addition, the recombination rate of fully ionized helium is about five times higher than that of hydrogen. Therefore, the reionization of helium is expected to be completed at a later epoch when the density of photons with $\lambda<304$\,\AA was high enough. Since even massive stars do not generate photons exceeding this energy in large quantities, the photons leading to helium reionization presumably are emitted by quasars; therefore, the ionization of helium has to wait for the `quasar epoch' of the Universe, at $z\lesssim4$. From the statistical analysis of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and from the analysis of helium absorption lines and the helium Gunn-Peterson effect in high-redshift QSOs, a reionization redshift of $z\sim3$ for helium is obtained.

{\noindent}One of the challenges of current observational cosmology is to link the history of reionization, as outlined above, to the observation of the highest redshift sources (i.e., to see whether we can observe the sources which are responsible for cosmic reionization). Are the galaxy populations that we can find at very high redshifts sufficient to understand the reionization process? Here we shall mention some of the major obstacles for a direct observation probe of these ionizing sources.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}If reionization was caused by the energetic photons emitted during star formation, the remnants of this first generation of stars must be present in the post-reionization Universe, and thus be observable. Galaxies at redshift $z>6$ are observed, either as Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) or as sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs). Their stellar masses can be estimated from their observed light. However, most of the LBGs are observed only in the near-IR, which means that we see their restframe UV-emission. Converting the UV-light into a stellar mass is highly uncertain, since it depends strongly on the instantaneous star-formation rate. For LAEs, it is even more challenging to determine a stellar mass, since they are typically fainter in their broad-band (i.e., continuum) emission, which renders the determination of the stellar mass even more challenging.

{\noindent}Nevertheless, galaxies at very high redshift were found which appear to have high stellar masses, including a LAE at $z=6.6$ with an estimated stellar mass $M_*\gtrsim10^{11}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The high-redshift QSOs require a SMBH with $M\gtrsim10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to power their energy output, and these must be hosted in galaxies with very large stellar masses. Therefore, massive galaxies have formed very early on, delivering ionizing photons.

{\noindent}However, these highest mass objects are very rare and, by themselves, by far not able to explain reionization. This fact can be clearly seen by considering the spectral shape of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line of high-redshift QSOs. Figure \ref{fig:qsoreionization} shows the spectrum of three very high redshift QSOs near to the Lyman$\alpha$̨ emission line. Whereas all three QSO show essentially no flux blueward of Lyman$\alpha$, once the wavelength difference exceeds $\sim20$ {\AA} in the restframe, there is some transmitted flux very close to the Ly$\alpha$ transition. This near-zone transmission is understood as a region around the QSO where the intergalactic gas is fully ionized by the QSO, so it becomes transparent. The figure shows a clear trend that the size of this near zone decreases for higher redshifts, as would be expected due to the higher gas density and probably larger mean neutral fraction in the Universe. Thus, these very luminous objects are able to reionize the IGM in their immediate surroundings, but their effect is constrained to a rather limited volume. Most of the ionizing photons must come from the far more numerous lower-mass galaxies (i.e., far less luminous sources).

{\noindent}Gunn \& Peterson (1965) first proposed using Ly$\alpha$ resonance absorption in the spectrum of distant quasars as a direct probe to the neutral hydrogen density in the IGM at high redshift. For objects beyond reionization, neutral hydrogen in the IGM creates complete GP absorption troughs in the quasar spectrum blueward of Ly$\alpha$ emission. Observations of the GP effect directly constrain the evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction and the ionization state of the IGM.

{\noindent}The Gunn-Peterson optical depth to Ly$\alpha$ photons is

\begin{align*}
    \tau_\mathrm{GP} = \frac{\pi e^2}{m_ec^2}f_\alpha\lambda_\alpha H^{-1}(z)n_\mathrm{HI} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $f_\alpha$ is the oscillator strength of the Ly$\alpha$ transition, $\lambda_\alpha=1216$\,\AA, $H(z)$ is the
Hubble constant at redshift $z$, and $n_\mathrm{HI}$ is the density of neutral hydrogen in the IGM.

{\noindent}At high redshifts,

\begin{align*}
    \tau_\mathrm{GP}(z) = 4.9\times10^5 \left(\frac{\Omega_mh^2}{0.13}\right)^{-1/2} \left(\frac{\Omega_bh^2}{0.02}\right) \left(\frac{1+z}{7}\right)^{3/2} \left(\frac{n_\mathrm{HI}}{n_\mathrm{H}}\right) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}for a uniform IGM. Even a tiny neutral fraction, $X_\mathrm{HI}\sim10^{-4}$, gives rise to complete GP absorption. This test is only sensitive at the end of the reionization when the IGM is already mostly ionized, and the absorption saturates for the higher neutral fraction in the earlier stage.

{\noindent}At $z<5$, the IGM absorption is resolved into individual Ly$\alpha$ forest lines; their number density increases strongly with redshift: $N_\alpha(z)\propto(1+z)$. Earlier attempts to study GP absorption concentrated on measuring the amount of flux between individual Ly$\alpha$ forest lines using high-resolution spectroscopy to place limits on the diffuse neutral IGM. However, at $z>5$, even with a moderately high resolution spectrum, Ly$\alpha$ forest lines overlap severely, making it impossible to find a truly ``line-free'' region.

{\noindent}A more accurate picture of the IGM evolution interprets the Ly$\alpha$ forest as a fluctuating GP effect: absorption arises from low-density gas in the IGM that is in approximate thermal equilibrium between photoionization heating by the UV background and adiabatic cooling due to the Hubble expansion, rather than as discrete Lyα$\alpha$ forest clouds. The neutral hydrogen fraction and therefore the GP optical depth
depend on the local density of the IGM. By studying the evolution of the average transmitted flux or effective optical depth, one can trace the evolution of the UV ionizing background and neutral fraction of the IGM. At high-redshift, the IGM is highly clumpy, which must be taken into account in order to estimate the IGM ionization from observations.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}The SDSS provides large samples of luminous quasars over $0<z<6.5$. Fan et al. (2000, 2001a,b, 2003, 2004, 2006a) carried out a survey of i-dropout quasars ($z>5.7$) using the SDSS imaging data, resulting in the discovery of 19 luminous quasars in this redshift regime (Figure \ref{fig:sdssqso}). Other multicolour survey projects are also searching for quasars at similar redshifts. They provide by far the best probes of IGM evolution toward the end of the EoR.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}The observed spectrum of high-redshift QSOs bluewards of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line shows that an increasing fraction of the radiation is absorbed by neutral hydrogen on the line-of-sight. We have seen that the density of the Ly$\alpha$ forest increases with redshift (see Figures \ref{fig:qsoabsorption} and \ref{fig:sdssqso}) in such a way that only a tiny fraction of ionizing photons manage to escape absorption. This observation may be seen as an indication that we approach the EoR as the QSO redshift increases beyond $z\sim6$. However, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hivsz}, the mean neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen needed to cause this strong absorption of ionizing photons is still very small -- a neutral fraction of much less than 1\% is sufficient to entirely block the light of QSOs blueward of the Ly$\alpha$ emission. Hence, the strong absorption implied by QSO spectra cannot be taken as evidence for $z\sim6$ signalling the end of the EoR. Nevertheless, the trend of the data shown in Figure \ref{fig:hivsz} may suggest that beyond $z\sim6$, we may approach a phase where the neutral hydrogen fraction indeed starts to increase significantly.

{\noindent}Observing reionization directly may in principle be possible if a very high-redshift QSO could be identified whose absorption spectrum could reveal a tomographic view through the ionized `bubbles' of the IGM, as sketched in Figure \ref{fig:lyaforest}. But we point out again that the very dense Ly$\alpha$ forest seen towards QSOs at high redshift, is no unambiguous sign for approaching the redshift of reionization, because a very small fraction of neutral atoms (about 1\%) is already sufficient to produce a large optical depth for Ly$\alpha$ photons.

\subsection{Question 16}

The $21\,{\rm cm}$ line of hydrogen is expected to show up in absorption against the cosmic microwave background at some redshifts, and in emission at other redshifts. What physical processes lead to this behaviour?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The key to the detectability of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal hinges on the spin temperature $T_s$. Only if this temperature deviates from the background temperature, will a signal be observable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{200\lesssim z\lesssim 1100:}$ The residual free electron fraction left after recombination allows Compton scattering to maintain thermal coupling of the gas to the CMB, setting $T_k=T_\gamma$. The high gas density leads to effective collisional coupling so that $T_s=T_\gamma$ and we expect $\bar{T}_b=0$ and no detectable $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal.
    \item $\mathbf{40\lesssim z\lesssim 200:}$In this regime, the gas cools adiabatically so that $T_k\propto(1+z)^2$ leading to $T_k<T_\gamma$ and collisional coupling sets $T_s<T_\gamma$, leading to $\bar{T}_b<0$ and an early absorption signal. At this time, $T_b$ fluctuations are sourced by density fluctuations, potentially allowing the initial conditions to be probed.
    \item $\mathbf{z_*\lesssim z\lesssim 40:}$ As the expansion continues, decreasing the gas density, collisional coupling becomes ineffective and radiative coupling to the CMB sets $T_s=T_\gamma$, and there is no detectable $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal.
    \item $\mathbf{z_\alpha\lesssim z\lesssim z_*:}$ Once the first sources switch on at $z_*$, they emit both Ly$\alpha$ photons and X-rays. In general, the emissivity required for Ly$\alpha$ coupling is significantly less than that for heating $T_k$ above $T_\gamma$. We therefore expect a regime where the spin temperature is coupled to cold gas so that $T_s\sim T_k<T_\gamma$ and there is an absorption signal. Fluctuations are dominated by density fluctuations and variation in the Ly$\alpha$ flux. As further star formation occurs the Ly$\alpha$ coupling will eventually saturate ($x_\alpha\gg1$), so that by a redshift $z_\alpha$ the gas will everywhere be strongly coupled.
    \item $\mathbf{z_h\lesssim z\lesssim z_\alpha:}$ After Ly$\alpha$ coupling saturates, fluctuations in the Ly$\alpha$ flux no longer affect the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal. By this point, heating becomes significant and gas temperature fluctuations source $T_b$ fluctuations. While $T_k$ remains below $T_\gamma$ we see a $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal in absorption, but as $T_k$ approaches $T_\gamma$ hotter regions may begin to be seen in emission. Eventually by a redshift $z_h$ the gas will be heated everywhere so that $\bar{T}_k=T_\gamma$.
    \item $\mathbf{z_T\lesssim z\lesssim z_h:}$ After the heating transition, $T_k>T_\gamma$ and we expect to see a $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal in emission. The $21\,{\rm cm}$ brightness temperature is not yet saturated, which occurs at $z_T$, when $T_s\sim T_k\gg T_\gamma$. By this time, the ionization fraction has likely risen above the percent level. Brightness temperature fluctuations are sourced by a mixture of fluctuations in ionization, density and gas temperature.
    \item $\mathbf{z_r\lesssim z\lesssim z_T:}$ Continued heating drives $T_k\gg T_\gamma$ at $z_T$ and temperature fluctuations become unimportant. $T_s\sim T_k\gg T_\gamma$ and the dependence on $T_s$ may be neglected which greatly simplifies analysis of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ power spectrum. By this point, the filling fraction of HII regions probably becomes significant and ionization fluctuations begin to dominate the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal.
    \item $\mathbf{z\lesssim z_r:}$ After reionization, any remaining $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal originates primarily from collapsed islands of neutral hydrogen (damped Ly$\alpha$ systems).
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}These events are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:21cmannotated}.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}As the most common atomic species present in the Universe, hydrogen is a useful tracer of local properties of the gas. The simplicity of its structure (a proton and electron) belies the richness of the associated physics. The $21\,{\rm cm}$ line of hydrogen arises from the hyperfine splitting of the $1S$ ground state due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the proton and the electron. This splitting leads to two distinct energy levels separated by $\Delta E_{21\,\mathrm{cm}}=5.9\times10^{-6}\,{\rm eV}$, corresponding to a wavelength of $21\,{\rm cm}$ and a frequency of $1420\,{\rm MHz}$. This frequency is one of the most precisely known quantities in astrophysics having been measured to great accuracy from studies of hydrogen masers.

{\noindent}Radio telescopes look for emission by warm hydrogen gas within galaxies. Since the line is narrow with a well measured rest frame frequency it can be used in the local Universe as a probe of the velocity distribution of gas within our galaxy and other nearby galaxies. $21\,{\rm cm}$ rotation curves are often used to trace galactic dynamics. Traditional techniques for observing $21\,{\rm cm}$ emission have only detected the line in relatively local galaxies, although it has been seen in absorption against radio loud background sources from individual systems at redshifts $z\lesssim3$. A new generation of radio telescopes offers the exciting prospect of using the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line as a probe of cosmology.

{\noindent}In cosmological contexts the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line has been used as a probe of gas along the line of sight to some background radio source. The detailed signal depends upon the radiative transfer through gas along the line of sight. We recall the basic equation of radiative transfer (RT) for the specific intensity $I_\nu$ (per unit frequency $\nu$) in the absence of scattering along a path described by coordinate $s$

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}I_\nu}{\mathrm{d}s} = j_\nu - \alpha_\nu I_\nu ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}\,pc^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where absorption and emission by gas along the path are described by the coefficients $\alpha_\nu$ and $j_\nu$, respectively.

{\noindent}To simplify the discussion, we will work in the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) limit, appropriate here since the relevant photon frequencies $\nu$ are much smaller than the peak frequency of the CMB blackbody. This allows us to relate the intensity $I_\nu$ to a brightness temperature $T_b$ by the relation $I_\nu=2k_BT\nu^2/c^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant. We will also make use of the standard definition of the optical depth $\tau=\int\alpha_\nu\mathrm{d}s$. With this we may rewrite the equation of RT to give the radiative transfer for light from a background radio source of brightness temperature $T_r$ (primarily the CMB) along the line of sight through a cloud of optical depth $\tau_\nu$ and uniform excitation temperature $T_\mathrm{ex}$ so that the observed brightness temperature $T_b^\mathrm{obs}$ at a frequency $\nu$ is given by

\begin{align*}
    T_b^\mathrm{obs} = T_\mathrm{ex}(1-e^{-\tau_\nu})+T_r(\nu)e^{-\tau_\nu} ~ [{\rm K}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:21cm} provides a summary of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal showing the key features of the signal with the relevant cosmic time, frequency, and redshift scales indicated. The earliest period of the signal arises in the period after thermal decoupling of the ordinary matter (baryons) from the CMB, so that the gas is able to cool adiabatically with the expansion of the Universe. In these cosmic ``Dark Ages'', before the first stars have formed, the first structures begin to grow from the seed inhomogeneties thought to be produced by quantum fluctuations during inflation. The cold gas can be seen in a $21\,{\rm cm}$ absorption signal, which has both a mean value (shown in the bottom panel) and fluctuations arising from variation in density (shown in the top panel). Once the first stars and galaxies form, their light radically alters the properties of the gas. Scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons leads to a strong coupling between the excitation of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line spin states and the gas temperature. Initially, this leads to a strong absorption signal that is spatially varying due to the strong clustering of the rare first generation of galaxies. Next, the X-ray emission from these galaxies heats the gas leading to a $21\,{\rm cm}$ emission signal. Finally, ultraviolet photons ionize the gas producing dark holes in the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal within regions of ionized bubbles surrounding groups of galaxies. Eventually all of the hydrogen gas, except for that in a few dense pockets, is ionized.

Colouration indicates the strength of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ brightness as it evolves through two absorption phases (purple and blue), separated by a period (black) where the excitation temperature of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ hydrogen transition decouples from the temperature of the hydrogen gas, before it transitions to emission (red) and finally disappears (black) owing to the ionization of the hydrogen gas.

    \label{fig:21cm}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The excitation temperature of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line is known as the spin temperature $T_s$. It is defined through the ratio between the number densities $n_i$ of hydrogen atoms in the two hyperfine levels (which we label with a subscript $0$ and $1$ for the $1S$ singlet and $1S$ triplet levels, respectively)

\begin{align*}
    \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2}\exp\left(-\frac{T_*}{T_s}\right) ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $(g_1/g_0)=3$ is the ratio of the statistical degeneracy factors of the two levels, and $T_*\equiv hc/k_B\lambda_{21\,\mathrm{cm}}=0.068\,{\rm K}$.

{\noindent}With this definition, the optical depth of a cloud of hydrogen is then

\begin{align*}
    \tau_\nu = \int \left[1-\exp\left(-\frac{E_{10}}{k_BT_s}\right)\right]\sigma_0\phi(\nu)n_0\mathrm{d}s ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $n_0=n_\mathrm{H}/4$ with $n_\mathrm{H}$ being the hydrogen density, and we have denoted the $21\,{\rm cm}$ cross-section as $\sigma(\nu)=\sigma_0\phi(\nu)$, with $\sigma_0\equiv3c^22A_{10}/8\pi\nu^2$, where $A_{10}=2.85\times10^{-15}\,s^{-1}$ is the spontaneous decay rate of the spin-flip transition, and the line profile is normalized so that $\int\phi(\nu)\mathrm{d}\nu=1$. To evaluate this expression we need to find the column length as a function of frequency $s(\nu)$ to determine the range of frequencies $\mathrm{d}\nu$ over the path $\mathrm{d}s$ that correspond to a fixed observed frequency $\nu_\mathrm{obs}$. This can be done in one of two ways: by relating the path length to the cosmological expansion $\mathrm{d}s=−c\mathrm{d}z/(1+z)H(z)$ and the redshifting of light to relate the observed and emitted frequencies $\nu_\mathrm{obs}=\nu_\mathrm{em}/(1+z)$ or assuming a linear velocity profile locally $v=(\mathrm{d}\nu/\mathrm{d}s)s$ (the well known Sobolev approximation) and using the Doppler law $\nu_\mathrm{obs}=\nu_\mathrm{em}(1-v/c)$ self-consistently to $\mathcal{O}(v/c)$. Since the latter case describes the well known Hubble law in the absence of peculiar velocities these two approaches give identical results for the optical depth. The latter picture brings out the effect of peculiar velocities that modify the local velocity-frequency conversion.

{\noindent}The optical depth of this transition is small at all relevant redshifts, yielding a differential brightness temperature

\begin{align*}
    \delta T_b &= \frac{T_s-T_r}{1+z}(1-e^{-\tau_\nu}) \\
    &\approx \frac{T_s-T_r}{1+z}\tau \\
    &\approx 27x_\mathrm{HI}(1+f_b)\left(\frac{\Omega_bh^2}{0.023}\right)\left(\frac{0.15}{\Omega_mh^2}\frac{1+z}{10}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{T_s-T_r}{T_s}\right)\left(\frac{\partial_rv_r}{(1+z)H(z)}\right) ~ [{\rm mK}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Here $x_\mathrm{HI}$ is the neutral fraction of hydrogen, $f_b$ is the fractional overdensity in baryons,
and the final term arises from the velocity gradient along the line of sight $\partial_rv_r$.

{\noindent}The key to the detectability of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal hinges on the spin temperature. Only if this temperature deviates from the background temperature, will a signal be observable; the spin temperature and spatial variation in the spin temperature can be used to convey information about astrophysical sources.

{\noindent}Three processes determine the spin temperature: (i) absorption/emission of $21\,{\rm cm}$ photons from/to the radio background, primarily the CMB; (ii) collisions with other hydrogen atoms and with electrons; and (iii) resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons that cause a spin flip via an intermediate excited state. The rate of these processes is fast compared to the de-excitation time of the line, so that to a very good approximation the spin temperature is given by the equilibrium balance of these effects. In this limit,
the spin temperature is given by

\begin{align*}
    T_s^{-1} = \frac{T_\gamma^{-1} + x_\alpha T_\alpha^{-1} + x_cT_K^{-1}}{1+x_\alpha+x_c} ~ [{\rm K^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $T_\gamma$ is the temperature of the surrounding bath of radio photons, typically set by the CMB so that $T_\gamma=T_\mathrm{CMB}$; $T_\alpha$ is the colour temperature of the Ly$\alpha$ radiation field at the Ly$\alpha$ frequency and is closely coupled to the gas kinetic temperature $T_k$ by recoil during repeated scattering, and $x_c$, $x_\alpha$ are the coupling coefficients due to atomic collisions and scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons, respectively. The spin temperature becomes strongly coupled to the gas temperature when $x_\mathrm{tot}\equiv x_c+x_\alpha\gtrsim1$ and relaxes to $T_\gamma$ when $x_\mathrm{tot}\ll1$.

{\noindent}Two types of background radio sources are important for the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line as a probe of astrophysics. Firstly, we may use the CMB as a radio background source. In this case, $T_r = T_\mathrm{CMB}$ and the $21\,{\rm cm}$ feature is seen as a spectral distortion to the CMB blackbody at appropriate radio frequencies (since fluctuations in the CMB temperature are small $\Delta T_\mathrm{CMB}\sim10^{-5}$ the CMB is effectively a source of uniform brightness). The distortion forms a diffuse background that can be studied across the whole sky in a similar way to CMB anisotropies. Observations at different frequencies probe different spherical shells of the observable Universe, so that a 3D map can be constructed.

{\noindent}The second situation uses a radio loud point source, for example a radio loud quasar, as the background. In this case, the source will always be much brighter than the weak emission from diffuse hydrogen gas, $T_r\gg T_s$, so that the gas is seen in absorption against the source. The appearance of lines from regions of neutral gas at different distances to the source leads to a ``forest'' of lines known as the ``$21\,{\rm cm}$ forest'' in analogy to the Ly$\alpha$ forest. The high brightness of the background source allows the $21\,{\rm cm}$ forest to be studied with high frequency resolution so probing small scale structures ($\sim\,{\rm kpc}$) in the IGM. For useful statistics, many lines of sight to different radio sources are required, making the discovery of high redshift radio sources a priority.

    \label{fig:21cmschematic}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Collisions between different particles may induce spin-flips in a hydrogen atom and dominate the coupling in the early Universe where the gas density is high. Three main channels are available: collisions between two hydrogen atoms and collisions between a hydrogen atom and an electron or a proton. The collisional coupling for a species is

\begin{align*}
    x_c^i \equiv \frac{C_{10}}{A_{10}}\frac{T_*}{T_\gamma} = \frac{n_ik_{10}^i}{A_{10}}\frac{T_*}{T_\gamma},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $C_{10}$ is the collisional excitation rate, $k_{10}^i$ is the specific rate coefficient for spin de-excitation by collisions with species $i$ (in units of $cm^3s^{-1}$).

{\noindent}The total collisional coupling coefficient can be written as

\begin{align*}
    x_c &= x_c^\mathrm{HH} + x_c^\mathrm{eH} + x_c^\mathrm{pH} \\
        &= \frac{T_*}{A_{10}T_\gamma} \left[k_{1-0}^\mathrm{HH}(T_k)n_\mathrm{H}+k_{1-0}^{e\mathrm{H}}(T_k)n_e+k_{1-0}^{p\mathrm{H}}(T_k)n_p\right] ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $k_{1-0}^\mathrm{HH}$ is the scattering rate between hydrogen atoms, $k_{1-0}^{e\mathrm{H}}$ is the scattering rate between hydrogen atoms and electrons, and $k_{1-0}^{p\mathrm{H}}$ is the scattering rate between hydrogen atoms and protons.

{\noindent}We may express the $21\,{\rm cm}$ brightness temperature as a function of four variables $T_b=T_b(T_k,x_i,J_\alpha,n_\mathrm{H})$, where $x_i$ is the volume-averaged ionized fraction of hydrogen and $J_\alpha$ is the Ly$\alpha$ specific flux. In calculating the $21\,{\rm cm}$ signal, we require a model for the global evolution of and fluctuations in these quantities. Before looking at the evolution of the signal quantitatively, we will first outline the basic picture to delineate the most important phases.

{\noindent}An important feature of $T_b$ is that its dependence on each of these quantities saturates at some point, for example once the Ly$\alpha$ flux is high enough the spin and kinetic gas temperatures become tightly coupled and further variation in $J_\alpha$ becomes irrelevant to the details of the signal. This leads to conceptually separate regimes where variation in only one of the variables dominating fluctuations in the signal. These different regimes can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:21cm} and are shown in schematic form in Figure \ref{fig:21cmschematic}.

\subsection{Question 17}

What is the difference between scalar and tensor modes of perturbation in the early Universe, and how can you detect their presence?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Scalar modes are density perturbations at the surface of last scattering which form gravitational instabilities. These seed temperature fluctuations in the CMB as well as E-mode polarization. In contrast, tensor modes are known as gravitational waves which cause shearing of the spacetime metric (compression in one direction and stretching in the other) These seed not only temperature fluctuations and E-mode polarization but also B-mode polarization. These modes do not damp out the way that scalar modes do. 

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}Scalars, vectors, and tensors generate distinct patterns in the polarization of the CMB. However, although they separate cleanly into $m=0,\pm1,\pm2$ polarization patterns for a single plane wave perturbation in the coordinate system referenced to $\bm{k}$, in general there will exist a spectrum of fluctuations each with a different $\bm{k}$. Therefore the polarization pattern on the sky does not separate into $m=0,\pm1,\pm2$ modes. In fact, assuming statistical isotropy, one expects the ensemble averaged power for each multipole $\ell$ to be independent of $m$. Nonetheless, certain properties of the polarization patterns do survive superposition of the perturbations: in particular, its parity and its correlation with the temperature fluctuations.

{\noindent}\textbf{Scalar (compressible) perturbations}:

{\noindent}The most commonly considered and familiar types of perturbations are scalar modes. These modes represent perturbations in the (energy) density of the cosmological fluid(s) at last scattering and are the only fluctuations which can form structure though gravitational instability. Consider a single large-scale Fourier component of the fluctuation (i.e., for the photons, a single plane wave in the temperature perturbation). Over time, the temperature and gravitational potential gradients cause a bulk flow, or dipole anisotropy, of the photons. Both effects can be described by introducing an “effective” temperature

\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)_\mathrm{eff} = \left(\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right) + \psi,
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\psi$ is the gravitational potential. Gradients in the effective temperature always create flows from hot to cold effective temperature. Formally, both pressure and gravity act as sources of the momentum density of the fluid in a combination that is exactly the effective temperature for a relativistic fluid.

{\noindent} To avoid confusion, let us explicitly consider the case of adiabatic fluctuations, where initial perturbations to the density imply potential fluctuations that dominate at large scales. Here gravity overwhelms pressure in overdense regions causing matter to flow towards density peaks initially. Nonetheless, overdense regions are effectively cold initially because photons must climb out of the potential wells they create and hence lose energy in the process. Though flows are established from cold to hot temperature regions on large scales, they still go from hot to cold effective temperature regions. This property is true more generally of our adiabatic assumption: we hereafter refer only to effective temperatures to keep the argument general.

    \label{fig:scalar}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Let us consider the quadrupole component of the temperature pattern seen by an observer located in a trough of a plane wave. The azimuthal symmetry in the problem requires that $\bm{v}\parallel\bm{k}$ and hence the flow is irrotational $\nabla\times\bm{v}=0$. Because hotter photons from the crests flow into the trough from the $\pm k$ directions while cold photons surround the observer in the plane, the quadrupole pattern seen in a trough has an $m = 0$,

\begin{align*}
    Y_2^0 \propto 3\cos^2\theta-1,
\end{align*}

{\noindent}structure with angle $\bm{\hat{n}\cdot\hat{k}}=\cos\theta$ (see top of Figure \ref{fig:scalar}). The opposite effect occurs at the crests, reversing the sign of the quadrupole but preserving the $m=0$ nature in its local angular dependence. The full effect is thus described by a local quadrupole modulated by a plane wave in space, $-Y_2^0(\bm{\hat{n}})\exp(i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{x})$, where the sign denotes the fact that photons flowing into cold regions are hot. This infall picture must be modified slightly on scales smaller than the sound horizon where pressure plays a role, however the essential property that the flows are parallel to $\bm{\hat{k}}$ and thus generate an $m=0$ quadrupole remains true.

{\noindent}The sense of the quadrupole moment determines the polarization pattern through Thomson scattering. Recall that polarized scattering peaks when the temperature varies in the direction orthogonal to $\bm{\hat{n}}$. Consider then the tangent plane $\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta\times\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$ with normal $\bm{\hat{n}}$. This may be visualized in an angular ``lobe'' diagram such as the top of Figure \ref{fig:scalar} as a plane which passes through the ``origin'' of the quadrupole pattern perpendicular to the line of sight. The polarization is maximal when the hot and cold lobes of the quadrupole are in this tangent plane, and is aligned with the component of the colder lobe which lies in the plane. As $\theta$ varies from $0$ to $\pi/2$ (pole to equator) the temperature differences in this plane increase from zero (see middle of Figure \ref{fig:scalar} a). The local polarization at the crest of the temperature perturbation is thus purely in the N-S direction tapering off in amplitude toward the poles (see middle of Figure \ref{fig:scalar} b). This pattern represents a pure $Q$-field on the sky whose amplitude varies in angle as an $\ell=2,m=0$ tensor or spin-$2$ spherical harmonic (Newman \& Penrose, 1966)

\begin{align*}
    Q=\sin^2\theta,~~~~~U=0.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}In different regions of space, the plane wave modulation of the quadrupole can change the sign of the polarization, but not its sense.

{\noindent}This pattern (bottom of Figure \ref{fig:scalar}, thick lines) is of course not the only logical possibility for an $\ell=2,m=0$ polarization pattern. Its rotation by $45^\circ$ is also a valid configuration (thin lines). This represents a pure NW-SE (and by sign reversal NE-SW), or $U$-polarization pattern (a distinction between the two patterns being electric and magnetic modes).

{\noindent}\textbf{Vector (vortical) perturbations}:

{\noindent}Vector perturbations represent vortical motions of the matter, where the velocity field $\bm{v}$ obeys $\nabla\cdot\bm{v}=0$ and $\nabla\times\bm{v}\neq0$, similar to ``eddies'' in water. There is no associated density perturbation, and the vorticity is damped by the expansion of the Universe as are all motions that are not enhanced by gravity. However, the associated temperature fluctuations, once generated, do not decay as both $\Delta T$ and $T$ scale similarly with the expansion. For a plane wave perturbation, the velocity field $\bm{v}\perp\bm{k}$ with direction reversing in crests and troughs (see top of Figure \ref{fig:vector}). The radiation field at these extrema possesses a dipole pattern due to the Doppler shift from the bulk motion. Quadrupole variations vanish here but peak between velocity extrema. To see this, imagine sitting between crests and troughs. Looking up toward the trough, one sees the dipole pattern projected as a hot and cold spot across the zenith; looking down toward the crest, one sees the projected dipole reversed. The net effect is a quadrupole pattern in temperature with $m\pm1$

\begin{align*}
    Y_2^{\pm1}\propto\sin\theta\cos\theta\mathrm{e}{\pm i\phi}.
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[t!]

The scattering of a vector ($m=1$) quadrupole perturbation generates the $E$ pattern (yellow, thick lines) as opposed to the $B$, (purple, thin lines) pattern.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}The lobes are oriented at $45^\circ$ from $k$ and $v$ since the line
of sight velocity vanishes along $k$ and at $90$ degrees to $k$ here. The latter follows since midway between the crests and troughs $v$ itself is zero. The full quadrupole distribution is therefore described by $-iY_2^{\pm1}(\bm{\hat{n}})\exp(i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{x})$, where $i$ represents the spatial phase shift of the quadrupole with respect to the velocity.

{\noindent}Thomson scattering transforms the quadrupole temperature anisotropy into a local polarization field as before. Again, the pattern may be visualized from the intersection of the tangent plane to $\bm{\hat{n}}$ with the lobe pattern of the top of Figure \ref{fig:vector}. At the equator ($\theta=\pi/2$), the lobes are oriented $45^\circ$ from the line of sight $\bm{\hat{n}}$ and rotate into and out of the tangent plane with $\phi$. The polarization pattern here is a pure $U$-field which varies in magnitude as $\sin\phi$. At the pole $\theta=0$, there are no temperature variations in the tangent plane so the polarization vanishes. Other angles can equally well be visualized by viewing the quadrupole pattern at different orientations given by $\bm{\hat{n}}$.

{\noindent}The full $\ell=2,m=1$ pattern,

\begin{align*}
    Q=-\sin\theta\cos\theta\mathrm{e}^{i\phi},~~~~~U=-i\sin\theta\mathrm{e}^{i\phi}
\end{align*}

{\noindent}is displayed explicitly in the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:vector}. Note that the pattern is dominated by $U$-contributions especially near the equator.

{\noindent}\textbf{Tensor (gravitational wave) perturbations}:

{\noindent}Tensor fluctuations are transverse-traceless perturbations to the metric, which can be viewed as gravitational waves. A plane gravitational wave perturbation represents a quadrupolar ``stretching'' of space in the plane of the perturbation (see Figure \ref{fig:tensorquadrupole}). As the wave passes or its amplitude changes, a circle of test particles in the plane is distorted into an ellipse whose semi-major axis $\rightarrow$ semi-minor axis as the spatial phase changes from crest $\rightarrow$ trough (see the top of Figure \ref{fig:tensor}, yellow ellipses). Heuristically, the accompanying stretching of the wavelength of photons produces a quadrupolar temperature variation with an $m=\pm2$ pattern

\begin{align*}
    Y_2^{\pm2}\propto\sin^2\theta\mathrm{e}^{\pm2i\phi}
\end{align*}

{\noindent}in the coordinates defined by $\bm{\hat{k}}$.

    \label{fig:tensor}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Thomson scattering again produces a polarization pattern from the quadrupole anisotropy. At the equator, the quadrupole pattern intersects the tangent ($\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta\times\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$) plane with hot and cold lobes rotating in and out of the $\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$ direction with the azimuthal angle $\phi$. The polarization pattern is therefore purely $Q$ with a $\cos(2\phi)$ dependence. At the pole, the quadrupole lobes lie completely in the polarization plane and produces the maximal polarization unlike the scalar and vector cases. The full pattern,

\begin{align*}
    Q=(1+\cos^2\theta)\mathrm{e}^{2i\phi}~[{\rm Jy}], ~~~~~U=-2i\cos\theta\mathrm{e}^{2i\phi}~[{\rm Jy}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}is shown in the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:tensor} (real part). Note that $Q$ and $U$ are present in nearly equal amounts for the tensors.

{\noindent}\textit{Electric and Magnetic Modes}:

{\noindent}Any polarization pattern on the sky can be separated into ``electric'' ($E$) and ``magnetic'' ($B$) components. This decomposition is useful both observationally and theoretically. There are two equivalent ways of viewing the modes that reflect their global and local properties respectively. The nomenclature reflects the global property. Like multipole radiation, the harmonics of an $E$-mode have $(-1)^\ell$ parity on the sphere, whereas those of a $B$-mode have $(-1)^{\ell+1}$ parity. Under $\bm{\hat{n}}\rightarrow\bm{\hat{n}}$, the $E$-mode thus remains unchanged for even $\ell$, whereas the $B$-mode changes sign as illustrated for the simplest case $\ell=2,m=0$ in Figure \ref{fig:ebmodes} (recall that a rotation by $90^\circ$ represents a change in sign). Note that the $E$ and $B$ multipole patterns are $45^\circ$ rotations of each other, (i.e. $Q\rightarrow U$ and $U\rightarrow-Q$). Since this parity property is obviously rotationally invariant, it will survive integration over $\bm{\hat{k}}$.

{\noindent}The local view of $E$- and $B$-modes involves the second derivatives of the polarization amplitude (second derivatives because polarization is a tensor or spin-$2$ object). In much the same way that the distinction between electric and magnetic fields in electromagnetism involves vanishing of gradients or curls (i.e., first derivatives) for the polarization there are conditions on the second (covariant) derivatives of $Q$ and $U$. For an $E$-mode, the difference in second (covariant) derivatives of $U$ along $\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta$ and $\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$ vanishes as does that for $Q$ along $\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta+\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$ and $\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta-\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$. For a $B$-mode, $Q$ and $U$ are interchanged. Recalling that a $Q$-field points in the $\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta$ or $\bm{\hat{e}}_\phi$ direction and a $U$-field in the crossed direction, we see that the Hessian or curvature matrix of the polarization amplitude has principle axes in the same sense as the polarization for $E$ and $45^\circ$ crossed with it for $B$ (see Figure \ref{fig:ebmodes}). Stated another way, near a maximum of the polarization (where the first derivative vanishes) the direction of greatest change in the polarization is parallel/perpendicular and at $45^\circ$ degrees to the polarization in the two cases.

{\noindent}The distinction is best illustrated with examples. Take the simplest case of $\ell=2,m=0$ where the $E$-mode is a $Q=\sin^2\theta$ field and the $B$-mode is a $U=\sin^2\theta$ field (see the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:scalar}). In both cases, the major axis of the curvature lies in the $\bm{\hat{e}}_\theta$ direction. For the $E$-mode, this is in the same sense; for the $B$-mode it is crossed with the polarization direction. The same holds true for the $m=1,2$ modes as can be seen by inspection of the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:vector} and the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:tensor}.

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/cosmology/CMBquad.png}
    \caption{\footnotesize{Modulation of the local pattern in the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:scalar} by plane wave fluctuations on the last scattering surface.

Modulation can mix $E$ and $B$ however if $U$ is also present. Image taken from Hu \& White (1997).}}
    \label{fig:cmbquad}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Thomson scattering can only produce an $E$-mode locally since the spherical harmonics that describe the temperature anisotropy have $(-1)^\ell$ electric parity. In the tops of Figures \ref{fig:scalar}, \ref{fig:vector}, and \ref{fig:tensor}, the $\ell=2,m=0,1,2$ $E$-mode patterns are shown in yellow. The $B$-mode represents these patterns rotated by $45^\circ$ and are shown in purple and cannot be generated by scattering. In this way, the scalars, vectors, and tensors are similar in that scattering produces a local $\ell=2$ $E$-mode only.

{\noindent}However, the pattern of polarization on the sky is not simply this local signature from scattering but is modulated over the last scattering surface by the plane wave spatial dependence of the perturbation (compare the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:scalar} and \ref{fig:cmbquad}). The modulation changes the amplitude, sign, and angular structure of the polarization but not its nature, e.g. a $Q$-polarization remains Q. Nonetheless, this modulation generates a $B$-mode from the local $E$-mode pattern.

{\noindent}The reason why this occurs is best seen from the local distinction between $E$ and $B$-modes. Recall that $E$-modes have polarization amplitudes that change parallel or perpendicular to, and $B$-modes in directions $45^\circ$ away from, the polarization direction. On the other hand, plane wave modulation always changes the polarization amplitude in the direction $\bm{\hat{k}}$ or N-S on the sphere. Whether the resultant pattern possesses $E$ or $B$-contributions depends on whether the local polarization has $Q$ or $U$-contributions.

{\noindent}For scalars, the modulation is of a pure $Q$-field and thus its $E$-mode nature is preserved (Kamionkowski et al. 1997; Zaldarriaga \& Seljak 1997). For the vectors, the $U$-mode dominates the pattern and the modulation is crossed with the polarization direction. Thus vectors generate mainly $B$-modes for short wavelength fluctuations (Hu \& White 1997). For the tensors, the comparable $Q$ and $U$ components of the local pattern imply a more comparable distribution of $E$ and $B$ modes at short wavelengths (see Figure \ref{fig:polpatterns}a).

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/cosmology/PolPatterns.png}
    \caption{\footnotesize{The $E$ and $B$ components of a plane wave perturbation. (a) Modulation of the local $E$-quadrupole pattern (yellow) from scattering by a plane wave. Modulation in the direction of (or orthogonal to) the polarization generates an $E$-mode with higher $\ell$; modulation in the crossed ($45^\circ$) direction generates a $B$-mode with higher $\ell$. Scalars generate only $E$-modes, vectors mainly $B$-modes, and tensors comparable amounts of both. (b) Distribution of power in a single plane wave with $kr=100$ in multipole $\ell$ from the addition of spin and orbital angular momentum.

    \label{fig:polpatterns}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}These qualitative considerations can be quantified by noting that plane wave modulation simply represent the addition of angular momentum from the plane wave ($Y_\ell^0$) with the local spin angular dependence. The result is that plane wave modulation takes the $\ell=2$ local angular dependence to higher $\ell$ (smaller angles) and splits the signal into $E$ and $B$ components with ratios which are related to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. At short wavelengths, these ratios are $B/E=0$, $6$, $8/13$ in power for scalars, vectors, and tensors (see Figure \ref{fig:polpatterns}b and Hu \& White 1997).

{\noindent}The distribution of power in multipole $\ell$-space is also important. Due to projection, a single plane wave contributes to a range of angular scales  $\ell\lesssim kr$ where $r$ is the comoving distance to the last scattering surface. From Figure \ref{fig:cmbquad}, we see that the smallest angular, largest $\ell\approx kr$ variations occur on lines of sight $\bm{\hat{n}}\cdot\bm{\hat{k}}=0$ or $\theta=\pi/2$ though a small amount of power projects to $\ell\ll kr$ as $\theta\rightarrow0$. The distribution of power in multipole space of Figure \ref{fig:polpatterns}b can be read directly off the local polarization pattern. In particular, the region near $\theta=\pi/2$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:polpatterns}a determines the behavior of the main contribution to the polarization power spectrum.

{\noindent}The full power spectrum is of course obtained by summing these plane wave contributions with weights dependent on the source of the perturbations and the dynamics of their evolution up to last scattering. Sharp features in the $k$-power spectrum will be preserved in the multipole power spectrum to the extent that the projectors in Figure \ref{fig:polpatterns}b approximate delta functions. For scalar $E$-modes, the sharpness of the projection is enhanced due to strong $Q$-contributions near $\theta=\pi/2$ $(\ell\sim kr)$ that then diminish as $\theta\rightarrow0$ $(\ell\ll kr)$. The same enhancement occurs to a lesser extent for vector $B$-modes due to $U$ near $\pi/2$ and tensor $E$-modes due to $Q$ there. On the other hand, a suppression occurs for vector $E$ and tensor $B$-modes due to the absence of $Q$ and $U$ at $\pi/2$ respectively. These considerations have consequences for the sharpness of features in the polarization power spectrum, and the generation of asymptotic ``tails'' to the polarization spectrum at low-$\ell$ (see Hu \& White 1997) .

\subsection{Question 18}

What are the similarities and differences between the cosmic neutrino background and the cosmic microwave background?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The CMB is from $\sim380,000$ years after the BB (or a redshift of $z\sim1100$), while the CNB is from $\sim1$ second after the BB.
    \item The CMB occurred when the Universe was $\sim1,000\,{\rm K}$ (or $\sim0.1\,{\rm eV}$) while that of the CNB was $\sim10^{10}\,{\rm K}$ (or $\sim1\,{\rm MeV}$).
    \item The expansion of the Universe has cooled the temperature of the CMB to $\sim2.7\,{\rm K}$ and the CNB to $\sim1.95\,{\rm K}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Just as the CMB is a relic of the time when the Universe was opaque to photons, the CNB is a relic of the time when the Universe was hot and dense enough to be opaque to neutrinos. The number density of each of the three flavors of neutrinos ($\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\nu_\tau$) has been calculated to be 3/11 times the number density of CMB photons. This means that at any moment, about twenty million cosmic neutrinos are zipping through your body.

{\noindent}The CMB yields information about our Universe at around $380,000$ years after the BB. Due to the weak interaction of the neutrinos with matter the CNB should give information about a much earlier time of our Universe, around one second after the Big Bang.

{\noindent}The CNB (often also called `relic neutrinos') decouples from matter about 1 second after the BB in the radiation dominated era at a temperature of $10^{10}\,{\rm K}\equiv1\,{\rm MeV}$. Today due to the expansion and cooling of the Universe the relic neutrino temperature is $1.95\,{\rm K}$ and the average neutrino density in the Universe is $340\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$ or $56\nu_e\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$.

{\noindent}The existence of a CNB (the analogue of the CMB) is a fundamental prediction of standard big bang cosmology. Up to now, the observational evidence for its existence is rather indirect and rests entirely on cosmological observations of, e.g., the light elemental abundances, the anisotropies in the CMB, and the large scale distribution of matter. All these measurements, however, probe the presence of relic neutrinos only at early stages in the cosmological evolution and, moreover, in a rather indirect way. The most promising laboratory search, based on neutrino capture on beta decaying nuclei, may be done in future experiments designed to measure the neutrino mass through decay kinematics.

{\noindent}Since the neutrinos interact with matter only by the weak interaction they decouple much earlier than the photons, which interact by the electromagnetic force. The decoupling of the neutrinos from matter is determined by the competition of the expansion rate of the Universe (Hubble parameter) and the interaction rate of the neutrinos with matter, occurring about 1 second after the BB.

{\noindent}Despite its successes, the standard model is known to be incomplete, and in at least one aspect, it directly conflicts with observations: according to the standard model, neutrinos should be massless. However, the Solar neutrino problem and its solution has shown this to be not the case: The (electron) neutrinos generated through nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun can escape, due to their small interaction cross section. These Solar neutrinos can be detected in (big!) terrestrial detectors. However, the measured rate of electron neutrinos from the Sun is only half as large as expected from Solar models. This Solar neutrino problem kept physicists and astrophysicists busy for decades. Its solution consists of a purely quantum-mechanical process, that of neutrino oscillations. It it possible that during its propagation, an electron neutrino transforms into a muon or tau neutrino, and back again. The existence of such oscillations was speculated for a long time, and provides a possible explanation for the missing rate of Solar electron neutrinos. Indeed, in 2001 the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory showed that neutrinos of all three flavors are received from the Sun, and that the sum of the rates of these neutrinos is compatible with the predicted rate from Solar models. In the meantime, these neutrino oscillation have also been observed in terrestrial experiments with neutrino beams.

{\noindent}Whereas neutrino oscillations are therefore well established today, they are in conflict with the Standard Model, according to which neutrinos have zero rest mass. From Special Relativity one can easily show that massless particles can not change their `identity' while propagating through space. The existence of neutrino oscillations necessarily requires that neutrinos have a finite rest mass. Indeed, the oscillation experiments were able to constrain these masses, since they determine the length-scale over which the flavor of neutrinos changes -- more precisely, it depends on the difference of their squared mass $m_i^2$. One finds that $\lvert m_2^2-m_1^2\rvert=(7.6\pm0.2)\times10^{-5}\,{\rm eV}$ and $\lvert m_3^2-m_3^2\rvert \approx \lvert m_3^2-m_1^2\rvert =(2.4\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$. These squared-mass differences thus do not provide us with an absolute mass scale of neutrinos, but their mass is non-zero. That means that neutrinos contribute to the cosmic matter density today, giving a contribution of

\begin{align*}
    \Omega_\nu h^2 = \frac{\Sigma m_\nu}{91.5\,{\rm eV}},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}which depends only on the sum of the three neutrino masses -- since the number density of neutrinos is known from the thermal history after the Big Bang. If the neutrino masses take the lowest values allowed by the squared-mass differences given above, this contribution is about 0.1\%. Observations of the large-scale structure in the Universe show that neutrinos cannot contribute a substantial fraction to the matter density. Indeed, these observations yield a constraint of $\Sigma m_{\nu,i}=0.1\,{\rm eV}$, and thus the upper bound on neutrino masses from cosmology are much stricter than those obtained from laboratory experiments. For the electron neutrino, an upper limit on its mass was determined from decay experiments of tritium, yielding $m_{\nu_e}\lesssim2\,{\rm eV}$, which together with the results from neutrino oscillations implies a maximum density of $\Omega_\nu<0.12$.


{\noindent}The standard model assumed that there are three families of neutrinos, and that they are essentially massless. One can relax one of these assumptions, or both together, to see whether the CMB data show a preference for a non-standard picture of the neutrino sector. If the sum of the neutrino masses is significantly larger than the minimum mass required from neutrino oscillations, then they would contribute to the current matter density in the Universe in the form of hot dark matter, and thus affect the shape of the power spectrum. If the number of neutrino families is larger than three, there would be a larger radiation component in the early Universe, changing the expansion law and the epoch of matter-radiation equality. All of this affects the CMB fluctuations.

{\noindent}Significant constraints on the neutrino masses and the number of neutrino families can thus be obtained from the CMB results. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:neutrinomasses}, the CMB alone yields a $2\sigma$ upper limit on the neutrino mass of $\Sigma m_\nu<0.60\,{\rm eV}$ and limits the effective number of neutrinos to $N_\mathrm{eff}=3.29^{+0.67}_{-0.64}$. These constraints get even tighter when the results from the BAOs are included in the analysis, yielding $\Sigma m_\nu<0.28\,{\rm eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff}=3.29^{+0.54}_{-0.652}$. The former results presents the strongest bound on the neutrino masses yet available, it is a mere factor of $\sim4$ larger than the lower bound derived from neutrino oscillations. The latter result confirms our picture of particle physics, according to which there are three families of leptons, and thus three kinds of neutrinos.

\subsection{Question 19}

What is the difference between an isocurvature mode and an adiabatic mode, in terms of the initial density perturbations in the early Universe? How do we know that the initial conditions are mostly adiabatic?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

An isocurvature mode is one in which density fluctuations of various components balance one another in such a way that there is no net change in the spacetime metric. This is in contrast to adiabatic modes where density fluctuations are proportional to one another which results in a net change of spacetime curvature. 

\subsubsection{Additional context}

In a complete description of energy density perturbations, the total energy density of the Universe includes components of baryonic matter ($\rho_b$), dark matter ($\rho_c$), radiation ($\rho_\mathrm{rad}$), and dark energy ($\rho_\Lambda$):

\begin{align*}
    \rho(\mathbf{x},t) = \rho_b(\mathbf{x},t) + \rho_c(\mathbf{x},t) + \rho_\mathrm{rad}(\mathbf{x},t) + \rho_\Lambda(\mathbf{x},t).
\end{align*}

{\noindent}In terms of their global gravitational influence, dark matter and baryonic matter contribute and evolve equivalently, therefore on cosmological scales they can be combined into a total matter energy density $\rho_m = \rho_b + \rho_c$. Each component may have its own (primordial) perturbation character. Dark energy does not have any density fluctuations, so $\delta_\Lambda(\mathbf{x},t) = 0$. Since most of the structure formation happened during the \textit{matter-dominated era}, this mainly involves the evolution of matter linear perturbations $\delta_m(\mathbf{x},t)$.

{\noindent}Cosmological perturbations will evolve quite differently for different \textit{perturbation modes}, each of which are identified on the basis of the nature of radiation perturbations with respect to matter perturbations. \textit{Isothermal perturbation modes} only involve matter perturbations ($\delta_m$) while radiation remains uniformly distributed throughout the 
Universe ($\delta_\mathrm{rad} = 0$). On the other hand, the primordial perturbations $\delta_m$ and $\delta_\mathrm{rad}$ may be completely equivalent (except for a constant proportionality factor) corresponding to zero fluctuations in entropy; these are \textit{adiabatic perturbation modes}. A third type of perturbation is that of \textit{isocurvature perturbation modes} in which radiation and matter perturbations cancel each other out such that the local curvature remains equal to the global cosmological curvature. Moreover, the evolution of the various components is complicated to a considerable extent by their mutual interactions. A simple illustration is that of baryonic matter initially without density perturbations: while dark matter creates even deeper potential wells, baryonic matter will fall in and experience increasingly stronger perturbations. Also, in pre-recombination epoch, baryonic matter is closely coupled to radiation such that its evolution is seriously affected by the corresponding radiation pressure gradients.

\subsection{Question 20}

Give three examples of possible dark matter candidates (current or historical). What is their status observationally?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

There is no shortage of candidates for non-baryonic dark matter. The primary candidates include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles). These are currently purely theoretical and have yet to be detected.
    \item MACHOs (massive compact halo objects). These include white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, black holes etc. These have been detected, of course, but not in large enough quantities to describe the amount of dark matter necessary.
    \item Standard Model neutrinos. These have also been detected but would only work in a HDM cosmology which has already been ruled out in favour of CDM.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}There are even more particle candidates...

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sterile neutrinos.
    \item Axions. 
    \item Supersymmetric candidates.
        \item Neutralinos.
        \item Sneutrinos.
        \item Gravitinos.
        \item Axinos.
    \item Light scalar dark matter.
    \item Dark matter from little Higgs models.
    \item Kaluza-Klein states.
    \item Superheavy dark matter.
    \item Q-balls.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Follow-up Questions}

    \item What does the ``hot'' in HDM refer to?
    \item What distinguishes between HDM and CDM?
    \item What is MOND and how does it fit in with DM?
    \item What happens if we don't find WIMPs? How is this search going?

\subsection{Question 1}

Sketch out the Hubble sequence. What physical trends are captured by the classification system?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

    \caption{\footnotesize{Hubble’s `tuning fork' for galaxy classification. Adapted from: J. Kormendy \& R. Bender 1996, A Proposed Revision of the Hubble Sequence for Elliptical Galaxies, ApJ 464, L119, Fig. 1. Image taken from Schneider (2006).}}
    \label{fig:hubblesequence}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most luminous galaxies in the local Universe fit onto the Hubble sequence; they are either ellipticals, spirals, or belong to the class of S0 galaxies, which shares some properties with the two other classes.
    \item Spiral galaxies consist of a disk with spiral arm structure and a central bulge. They are divided into two subclasses: normal spirals (S's) and barred spirals (SB's).
    \item Elliptical galaxies (E's) are galaxies that have nearly elliptical isophotes without any clearly defined structure.
    \item S0 galaxies are a transition between ellipticals and spirals which are also called lenticulars as they are lentil-shaped galaxies. They contain a bulge and a large enveloping region of relatively unstructured brightness which often appears like a disk without spiral arms.
    \item Irregular galaxies (Irr's) are galaxies with only weak (Irr I) or no (Irr II) regular structure.
    \item Spirals contain a sizable fraction of gas, whereas the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in ellipticals is much smaller. As a consequence, spirals have ongoing star formation, ellipticals not, or only very little. As a further consequence, the light of elliptical galaxies is substantially redder than that of spirals.
    \item The stars in spirals have a very ordered motion, moving around the galactic center on nearly circular orbits in a common orbital plane, having a velocity dispersion that is much smaller than the orbital velocity; the stars in the disk are called `dynamically cold'. In contrast, the motion of stars in ellipticals is largely random, with fairly little coherent velocity; they are `dynamically hot'.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Historically, optical photometry was the method used to observe galaxies. Thus, the morphological classification defined by Hubble is still the best-known today. Besides morphological criteria, color indices, spectroscopic parameters (based on emission or absorption lines), the broad-band spectral distribution (galaxies with/without radio- and/or X-ray emission, or emission in the infrared), as well as other features may also be used.

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:hubblesequence} shows the classification scheme defined by Hubble. According to this, three main types of galaxies exist:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Elliptical galaxies (E's) are galaxies that have nearly elliptical isophotes without any clearly defined structure. They are subdivided according to their ellipticity $\epsilon\equiv1-b/a$, where $a$ and $b$ denote the semi-major and the semi-minor axes, respectively. Ellipticals are found over a relatively broad range in ellipticity, $0\leq\epsilon\leq0.7$. The notation E$n$ is commonly used to classify the ellipticals with respect to $\epsilon$, with $n=10\epsilon$; i.e., an E4 galaxy has an axis ratio of $b/a=0.6$, and E0's have circular isophotes.
    \item Spiral galaxies consist of a disk with spiral arm structure and a central bulge. They are divided into two subclasses: normal spirals (S's) and barred spirals (SB's). In each of these subclasses, a sequence is defined that is ordered according to the brightness ratio of bulge and disk, and that is denoted by a, ab, b, bc, c, cd, d. Objects along this sequence are often referred to as being either an early- type or a late-type; hence, an Sa galaxy is an early-type spiral, and an SBc galaxy is a late-type barred spiral. It's stressed explicitly that this nomenclature is not a statement of the evolutionary stage of the objects but is merely a nomenclature of purely historical origin.
    \item Irregular galaxies (Irr's) are galaxies with only weak (Irr I) or no (Irr II) regular structure. The classification of Irr's is often refined. In particular, the sequence of spirals is extended to the classes Sdm, Sm, Im, and Ir (m stands for Magellanic; the Large Magellanic Cloud is of type SBm).
    \item S0 galaxies are a transition between ellipticals and spirals which are also called lenticulars as they are lentil-shaped galaxies. They contain a bulge and a large enveloping region of relatively unstructured brightness which often appears like a disk without spiral arms. Ellipticals and S0 galaxies are referred to as early-type galaxies, spirals as late-type galaxies. As before, these names are only historical and are not meant to describe an evolutionary track!
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}Obviously, the morphological classification is at least partially affected by projection effects. If, for instance, the spatial shape of an elliptical galaxy is a triaxial ellipsoid, then the observed ellipticity will depend on its orientation with respect to the line-of-sight. Also, it will be difficult to identify a bar in a spiral that is observed from its side (`edge-on').

{\noindent}Besides the aforementioned main types of galaxy morphologies, others exist which do not fit into the Hubble scheme. Many of these are presumably caused by interaction between galaxies. Furthermore, we observe galaxies with radiation characteristics that differ significantly from the spectral behavior of `normal' galaxies.

{\noindent}In summary:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most luminous galaxies in the local Universe fit onto the Hubble sequence; they are either ellipticals, spirals, or belong to the class of S0 galaxies, which shares some properties with the two other classes.
    \item Ellipticals and spirals differ not only in their morphology, but in several other respects, for example: (1) Spirals contain a sizable fraction of gas, whereas the gas-to- stellar mass ratio in ellipticals is much smaller. As a consequence, (2) spirals have ongoing star formation, ellipticals not, or only very little. As a further consequence, (3) the light of elliptical galaxies is substantially redder than that of spirals. Obviously, the morphology of galaxies and the properties of their stellar populations are strongly correlated.
    \item The stars in spirals have a very ordered motion, moving around the galactic center on nearly circular orbits in a common orbital plane, having a velocity dispersion that is much smaller than the orbital velocity; the stars in the disk are called `dynamically cold'. In contrast, the motion of stars in ellipticals is largely random, with fairly little coherent velocity; they are dynamically hot.
    \item Some elliptical galaxies show clear signs of complex structure, which are interpreted as indications of past interaction with other galaxies. In contrast, the disks of spirals are very thin, which means that they have been largely unperturbed for a long while in the past.
    \item The rotation curves of spiral galaxies are almost flat for large radii, in contrast to what would be expected from the visible mass distribution that declines exponentially outwards. This implies that there is more matter than seen in stars and gas -- the galaxies are embedded in a halo of dark matter. Whereas for elliptical galaxies the radial density distribution is more difficult to probe, the presence of dark matter has been verified also for ellipticals.
    \item Both spirals and ellipticals follow scaling relations which connect their luminous properties (luminosity or surface brightness) with their dynamical properties (rotational velocity or velocity dispersion). Hence, the formation and evolution of galaxies and their stellar populations must proceed in a way as to place them onto these scaling relations.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}The light from `normal' galaxies is emitted mainly by stars. Therefore, the spectral distribution of the radiation from such galaxies is in principle a superposition of the spectra of their stellar population. The spectrum of stars is, to a first approximation, described by a Planck function that depends only on the star's surface temperature. A typical stellar population covers a temperature range from a few thousand Kelvin up to a few tens of thousand Kelvin. Since the Planck function has a well-localized maximum and from there steeply declines to both sides, most of the energy of such `normal' galaxies is emitted in a relatively narrow frequency interval that is located in the optical and NIR sections of the spectrum.

{\noindent}The classification of galaxies by morphology, given by the Hubble classification scheme (Figure \ref{fig:hubblesequence}), has the disadvantage that morphologies of galaxies are not easy to quantify. Traditionally, this was done by visual inspection but of course this method bears some subjectivity of the researcher doing it and requires a lot of experience. Furthermore, this visual inspection is time consuming and cannot be performed on large samples of galaxies. Various techniques and related software were developed to perform such a classification automatically, in many cases with significant success, including the reproducibility of galaxy classification between different methods. Nevertheless, quite a number of problems remain, such as the inclination dependence of the morphological appearance of a galaxy.

{\noindent}Even automatic classifications cannot be applied to galaxies for which the angular resolution of the imaging is not much better than the angular size of galaxies, that is, for distant objects. An alternative to morphological classification is provided by the colours of galaxies, which can be obtained from broad-band multi-color imaging. Colors are much easier to measure than morphology, in particular for very small galaxies. In addition, the physical properties of galaxies may be better characterized by their colors than by their morphology -- the colours yield information about the stellar population, whereas the morphology is determined by the dynamics of the galaxy.

{\noindent}Using photometric measurements and spectroscopy from the SDSS, the colours and absolute magnitudes of low-redshift galaxies have been studied; their density distribution in a color-magnitude diagram is plotted in the left-hand side of Figure \ref{fig:sdsscmd}. We see immediately that there are two density peaks of the galaxy distribution in this diagram: one at high luminosities and red color, the other at significantly fainter absolute magnitudes and much bluer color. It appears that the galaxies are distributed at and around these two density peaks, hence galaxies tend to be either luminous and red, or less luminous and blue. We can also easily see from this diagram that the distribution of red and blue galaxies with respect to their luminosity is different, the former one being more shifted towards larger luminosity.

{\noindent}We can next consider the color distribution of galaxies at a fixed absolute magnitude $M_r$. This is obtained by plotting the galaxy number density along vertical cuts through the left-hand side of Figure \ref{fig:sdsscmd}. When this is done for different $M_r$, it turns out that the colour distribution of galaxies is bimodal: over a broad range in absolute magnitude, the color distribution has two peaks, one at red, the other at blue $u-r$. Again, this fact can be seen directly from Figure \ref{fig:sdsscmd}. For each value of $M_r$, the colour distribution of galaxies can be very well fitted by the sum of two Gaussian functions. The central colors of the two Gaussians are shown by the two dashed curves in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:sdsscmd}. They become redder the more luminous the galaxies are. This luminosity-dependent reddening is considerably more pronounced for the blue population than for the red galaxies.

{\noindent}To see how good this fit indeed is, the right-hand side of Figure \ref{fig:sdsscmd} shows the galaxy density as obtained from the two-Gaussian fits, with solid contours corresponding to the red galaxies and dashed contours to the blue ones. We thus conclude that the local galaxy population can be described as a bimodal distribution in $u-r$ color, where the characteristic color depends slightly on absolute magnitude. The galaxy distribution at bright absolute magnitudes is dominated by red galaxies, whereas for less luminous galaxies the blue population dominates.

{\noindent}The mass-to-light ratio of a red stellar population is larger than that of a blue population, since the former no longer contains massive luminous stars. The difference in the peak absolute magnitude between the red and blue galaxies therefore corresponds to an even larger difference in the stellar mass of these two populations. Red galaxies in the local Universe have on average a much higher stellar mass than blue galaxies. This fact is illustrated by the two dotted lines in the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:sdsscmd} which correspond to lines of constant stellar mass of $\sim2-3\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}$. This seems to indicate a very characteristic mass scale for the galaxy distribution: most galaxies with a stellar mass larger than this characteristic mass scale are red, whereas most of those with a lower stellar mass are blue.

    \label{table:lategalaxies}
\end{table}

{\noindent}Looking at the sequence of early-type spirals (i.e., Sa's or SBa's) to late-type spirals, we find a number of differences that can be used for classification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A decreasing luminosity ratio of bulge and disk, with $L_\mathrm{bulge}/L_\mathrm{disk}\sim0.3$ for Sa’s and $\sim0.05$ for Sc’s
    \item An increasing opening angle of the spiral arms, from   $6^\circ$ for Sa's to $18^\circ$ for Sc's.
    \item An increasing brightness structure along the spiral arms: Sa's have a `smooth' distribution of stars along the spiral arms, whereas the light distribution in the spiral arms of Sc's is resolved into bright knots of stars and HII regions.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}Bars are common in spiral galaxies, with $\sim70\%$ of all disk galaxies containing a large-scale stellar bar. Such a bar perturbs the axial symmetry of the gravitational potential in a galaxy, which may have a number of consequences. One of them is that this perturbation can lead to a redistribution of angular momentum of the stars, gas, and dark matter. In addition, by perturbing the orbits, gas can be driven towards the center of the galaxy which may have important consequences for triggering nuclear activity and enhanced star formation.

{\noindent}The light profile of the bulge of spirals is described by a de Vaucouleurs profile to a first approximation, while the disk follows an exponential brightness profile, as is the case for our MW. Expressing these distributions of the surface brightness in $\mu\propto-2.5\log(I)$, measured in ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$, we obtain

\begin{align*}
    \mu_\mathrm{bulge} = \mu_e + 8.3268\left[\left(\frac{R}{R_e}\right)^{1/4}-1\right] ~ [{\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and

\begin{align*}
    \mu_\mathrm{disk} = \mu_0 + 1.09\left(\frac{R}{h_R}\right) ~ [{\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Here, $\mu_e$ is the surface brightness at the effective radius $R_e$ which is defined such that half of the bulge luminosity is emitted within $R_e$. The central surface brightness and the scale-length of the disk are denoted by $\mu_0$ and $h_R$, respectively. It has to be noted that $\mu_0$ is not directly measurable since $\mu_0$ is not the central surface brightness of the galaxy, only that of its disk component. To determine $\mu_0$, the exponential law is extrapolated from large $R$ inwards to $R=0$, or more precisely, by fitting the sum of an exponential and a bulge component to the total light profile of the galaxy.

{\noindent}The brightness profile of spiral disks perpendicular to the disk can be studied exclusively in edge-on spirals. From them, one finds that it is in general well described by an exponential law. The scale-height $h_z$ of the disk is almost independent of the galacto-centric radius $R$, and between galaxies scales roughly linearly with the rotational velocity of the disk. The typical value for the ratio of scale-height to scale-length is $h_z/h_R=0.07$ -- indeed, the disks of spiral galaxies are thin. The flattest galaxies are those of late Hubble type.

{\noindent}While the brightness profile of bulges follows approximately that of a de Vaucouleurs profile, some spiral galaxies bulges were found which behave differently than these `classical' bulges; one calls them pseudobulges. In contrast to classical bulges, they follow more an exponential profile, are typically flatter, and have significant rotational support. Furthermore, whereas classical bulges lie on the same sequence in the effective radius vs. absolute magnitude diagram as the ellipticals, pseudobulges do not. They have lower luminosity for a given size.

{\noindent}In many cases it is very difficult to distinguish between both types of bulges photometrically. However, spectroscopy aids a lot in this distinction. In fact, some bulges of spirals have two components, i.e., both a classical bulge and a pseudobulge.

{\noindent}The differences in the two types of bulges suggest that they should have a different origin. Classical bulges behave like a small elliptical galaxy. It is believed that ellipticals form through merging events of galaxies which `heats up' the stellar velocity distribution (i.e., turns ordered velocity fields of disk galaxies into random orbits which are characteristic for ellipticals). Therefore, in the current model of galaxy evolution, classical bulges are also formed as a result of merger events. In contrast, the ordered rotation of pseudobulges suggests that they have evolved from the disk population. For example, symmetry perturbations of the gravitational field caused by a bar can generate random velocity components of stars perpendicular to the plane of the disk, and thus thicken the disk population in the inner part of a galaxy.

{\noindent}Whereas pseudobulges may provide important insights into the evolution of galaxies, they are a sub-dominant component in the population of galaxies. It is estimated that classical bulges together contain about ten times more stars than pseudobulges. Therefore, whenever the term `bulge' is used, it's often implicitly meant to refer to the classical bulges.

{\noindent}Some late-type spiral galaxies seem to have no bulge component. Some of them show instead a nuclear stellar cluster at their center. These nuclear star clusters appear at first sight to be similar to globular clusters. However, their stellar population is quite different from that of the old globular clusters in our Galaxy, as their light is dominated by a relatively young stellar population, although their stellar mass is totally dominated by an old population. In some respect, these nuclear star clusters share properties with the peculiar Galactic globular $\omega$ Centauri, which also shows a broad range of stellar ages and an inhomogeneous chemical abundance. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that $\omega$ Centaurus is the remnant of a merger of a lower mass galaxy with the MW.

{\noindent}The general term `elliptical galaxies' (or ellipticals, for short) covers a broad class of galaxies which differ in their luminosities and sizes. A rough subdivision is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Normal ellipticals. This class includes giant ellipticals (gE's), those of intermediate luminosity (E's), and compact ellipticals (cE's), covering a range in absolute magnitudes from $M_B\sim23$ to $M_B\sim15$.
    \item Dwarf ellipticals (dE's). These differ from the cE's in that they have a significantly smaller surface brightness and a lower metallicity.
    \item cD galaxies. These are extremely luminous (up to $M_B\sim25$) and large (up to $R\sim1{\rm Mpc}$) galaxies that are only found near the centers of dense clusters of galaxies. Their surface brightness is very high close to the center, they have an extended diffuse envelope, and they have a very high $M/L$ ratio. It is not clear whether the extended envelope actually `belongs' to the galaxy or is part of the galaxy cluster in which the cD is embedded, since such clusters are now known to have a population of stars located outside of the cluster galaxies.
    \item Blue compact dwarf galaxies. These `blue compact dwarfs' (BCD’s) are clearly bluer (with $(B-V)$ between $0.0$ and $0.3$) than the other ellipticals, and contain an appreciable amount of gas in comparison.
    \item Dwarf spheroidals (dSph's) exhibit a very low luminosity and surface brightness. They have been observed down to $M_B\sim8$. Due to these properties, they have thus far only been observed in the Local Group.

{\noindent}Analyzing the morphology of elliptical galaxies raises a simple question: Why are ellipticals not round? A simple explanation would be rotational flattening, i.e., as in a rotating self-gravitating gas ball, the stellar distribution bulges outwards at the equator due to centrifugal forces, as is also the case for the Earth. If this explanation was correct, the rotational velocity $v_\mathrm{rot}$, which is measurable in the relative Doppler shift of absorption lines, would have to be of about the same magnitude as the velocity dispersion of the stars $\sigma_v$ that is measurable through the Doppler broadening of lines. More precisely, by means of stellar dynamics one can show that for the rotational flattening of an axially symmetric, oblate galaxy, the relation

\begin{align*}
    \left(\frac{v_\mathrm{rot}}{\sigma_v}\right)_\mathrm{iso} = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon}} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}has to be satisfied, where `iso' indicates the assumption of an isotropic velocity distribution of the stars. However, for very luminous ellipticals one finds that, in general, $v_\mathrm{rot}\ll \sigma_v$, so that rotation cannot be the major cause of their ellipticity. In addition, many ellipticals are presumably triaxial, so that no unambiguous rotation axis is defined. Thus, luminous ellipticals are in general not rotationally flattened. For less luminous ellipticals and for the bulges of disk galaxies, however, rotational flattening can play an important role. The question remains of how to explain a stable elliptical distribution of stars without bulk rotation.

{\noindent}The brightness profile of an elliptical galaxy is defined by the distribution of its stellar orbits. Let us assume that the gravitational potential is given. The stars are then placed into this potential, with the initial positions and velocities following a specified distribution. If this distribution is not isotropic in velocity space, the resulting light distribution will in general not be spherical. For instance, one could imagine that the orbital planes of the stars have a preferred direction, but that an equal number of stars exists with positive and negative angular momentum $L_z$, so that the total stellar distribution has no net angular momentum and therefore does not rotate. Each star moves along its orbit in the gravitational potential, where the orbits are in general not closed. If an initial distribution of stellar orbits is chosen such that the statistical properties of the distribution of the orbits are invariant in time, then one will obtain a stationary system. If, in addition, the distribution is chosen such that the respective mass distribution of the stars will generate exactly the originally chosen gravitational potential, one arrives at a self-gravitating equilibrium system. In general, it is a difficult mathematical problem to construct such self-gravitating equilibrium systems. Furthermore, elliptical galaxies also contain a dark matter component, whose gravitational potential adds to that of the stars.

{\noindent}The question now arises whether such an equilibrium system can also be stable in time. One might expect that close encounters of pairs of stars would cause a noticeable disturbance in the distribution of orbits. These pair-wise collisions could then lead to a `thermalization' of the stellar orbits. To examine this question we need to estimate the time-scale for such collisions and the changes in direction they cause.

{\noindent}For this purpose, we consider the relaxation time-scale by pair collisions in a system of $N$ stars of mass $m$, total mass $M=Nm$, extent $R$, and a mean stellar density of $n=3N/(4\pi R^3)$. We define the relaxation time $t_\mathrm{relax}$ as the characteristic time in which a star changes its velocity direction by $\sim90^\circ$ due to pair collisions with other stars. By simple calculation (see below), we find that

\begin{align*}
    t_\mathrm{relax} \approx \frac{R}{6v} \frac{N}{\ln(N/2)} ~ [{\rm yr}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}or

\begin{align*}
    t_\mathrm{relax} = \frac{t_\mathrm{cross}}{6} \frac{N}{\ln(N/2)} ~ [{\rm yr}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $t_\mathrm{cross}=R/v$ is the crossing time-scale, i.e. the time it takes a star to cross the stellar system. If we now consider a typical galaxy, with $t_\mathrm{cross}\sim10^8\,{\rm yr}$, $N\sim10^{12}$ (thus $ln(N/2)\sim30$), then we find that the relaxation time is much longer than the age of the Universe. This means that pair collisions do not play any role in the evolution of stellar orbits. The dynamics of the orbits are determined solely by the large-scale gravitational field of the galaxy. There is a process called violent relaxation which most likely plays a central role in the formation of galaxies and which is probably also responsible for the stellar orbits establishing an equilibrium configuration.

{\noindent}We thus conclude that the stars behave like a collisionless gas: elliptical galaxies are stabilized by (dynamical) pressure, and they are elliptical because the stellar distribution is anisotropic in velocity space. This corresponds to an anisotropic pressure -- where we recall that the pressure of a gas is nothing but the momentum transport of gas particles due to their thermal motion.

\subsection{Question 2}

What is the total mass (in both dark matter and in stars) of the Milky Way galaxy? How does this compare to M31 and to the LMC? How is this mass determined?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The MWG has a total mass of about $10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. This is about the same as M31 (Andromeda), and larger than the LMC which is roughly $10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Assuming virial equlibrium, the mass can be determined from the flat part of the rotation curve via

\begin{align*}
    V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM(<R)}{R_0}} ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If spiral galaxies are being observed, the Tully-Fisher relation $L\propto v_\mathrm{max}^4$ can be used to determine the maximum orbital velocity in replacement of the rotation curve. Similarly, if elliptical galaxies are being observed, the Faber-Jackson relation $L\propto\sigma_v^4$ can be used instead.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The components of the Milky Way Galaxy (MWG) have total masses as follows: a disk mass of $4.5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, bulge mass of $4.5\times10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$, dark halo mass of $2\times10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, and BH mass of $4\times10^6\,{\rm M_\odot}$.

{\noindent}The Galactic disk rotates, with rotational velocity $V(R)$ depending on the distance $R$ from the center. We can estimate the mass of the Galaxy from the distribution of the stellar light and the mean mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population, since gas and dust represent less than $\sim10$\% of the mass of the stars. From this mass estimate we can predict the rotational velocity as a function of radius simply from Newtonian mechanics. However, the observed rotational velocity of the Sun around the Galactic center is significantly higher than would be expected from the observed mass distribution. If $M(<R_0)$ is the mass inside a sphere around the Galactic center with radius $R_0=8\,{\rm kpc}$, then the rotational velocity from Newtonian mechanics is

\begin{align*}
    V_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM(<R)}{R_0}} ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}From the visible matter in stars we would expect a rotational velocity of $160\,{\rm km\,s}$, but we observe $V_0=220\,{\rm km\,s}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:rotationcurve}). This discrepancy, and the shape of the rotation curve $V(R)$ for larger distances $R$ from the Galactic center, indicates that our Galaxy contains significantly more mass than is visible in the form of stars. This additional mass is called dark matter. Its physical nature is still unknown. The main candidates are weakly interacting elementary particles like those postulated by some elementary particle theories, but they have yet not been detected in the laboratory. Macroscopic objects (i.e., celestial bodies) are also in principle viable candidates if they emit very little light.

\subsection{Question 3}

Describe as many steps of the distance ladder and the involved techniques as you can. What are the rough distances to the Magellanic Clouds, Andromeda, and the Virgo Cluster?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The rough distances to the Magellanic Clouds, Andromeda, and the Virgo Cluster are as follows:

\begin{align*}
    d_\mathrm{LMC} \approx 300 ~ [{\rm kpc}] \\
    d_\mathrm{SMC} \approx 400 ~ [{\rm kpc}] \\
    d_\mathrm{M31} \approx 700 ~ [{\rm kpc}] \\
    d_\mathrm{Virgo} \approx 10 ~ [{\rm Mpc}].
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}\textbf{Trigonometric parallax ($<30\,{\rm pc}$)}: The most important method of distance determination is the trigonometric parallax, not only from a historical point-of-view. This method is based on a purely geometric effect and is therefore independent of any physical assumptions. Due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun the positions of nearby stars on the sphere change relative to those of very distant sources (e.g., extragalactic objects such as quasars). The latter therefore define a fixed reference frame on the sphere. In the course of a year the apparent position of a nearby star follows an ellipse on the sphere, the semi-major axis of which is called the parallax. The axis ratio of this ellipse depends on the direction of the star relative to the ecliptic (the plane that is defined by the orbits of the Earth and the other planets). The parallax depends on the radius $r$ of the Earth’s orbit, hence on the Earth-Sun distance which is, by definition, one astronomical unit (AU). Furthermore, the parallax depends on the distance $d$ of the star,

\begin{align*}
    \frac{r}{d} = \tan(p) \approx p ~ [{\rm rad}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where we used $p\ll1$ in the last step, and $p$ is measured in radians as usual. The trigonometric parallax is also used to define the common unit of distance in astronomy: one parsec (pc) is the distance of a hypothetical source for which the parallax is exactly $p=1''$. With the conversion of arcseconds to radians ($1''\approx4.848\times10^{-6}\,{\rm rad}$) one gets $p/1''=206265p$, which for a parsec yields

\begin{align*}
    1\,{\rm pc} = 206265\,{\rm AU} = 3.086\times10^{16}\,{\rm m}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The distance corresponding to a measured parallax is then
calculated as

\begin{align*}
    d = \left(\frac{p}{1''}\right)^{-1}\,{[\rm pc]}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}o determine the parallax p, precise measurements of the position of an object at different times are needed, spread over a year, allowing us to measure the ellipse drawn on the sphere by the object’s apparent position. For ground-based observations the accuracy of this method is limited by the atmosphere. The seeing causes a blurring of the images of astronomical sources and thus limits the accuracy of position measurements. From the ground this method is therefore limited to parallaxes larger than $\approx0.1''$, implying that the trigonometric parallax yields distances to stars only within $\approx30\,{\rm pc}$.

{\noindent}\textbf{Proper motions}: Stars are moving relative to us or, more precisely, relative to the Sun. To study the kinematics of the Milky Way we need to be able to measure the velocities of stars. The radial component $v_r$ of the velocity is easily obtained from the Doppler shift of spectral lines,

\begin{align*}
    v_r = \left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)c ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\lambda_)$ is the rest-frame wavelength of an atomic transition and $\Delta\lambda=\lambda-\lambda_0$ is the Doppler shift of the wavelength due to the radial velocity of the source. The sign of the radial velocity is defined such that $v_r>0$ corresponds to a motion away from us, i.e., to a redshift of spectral lines.

{\noindent}In contrast, the determination of the other two velocity components is much more difficult. The tangential component, $v_t$, of the velocity can be obtained from the proper motion of an object. In addition to the motion caused by the parallax, stars also change their positions on the sphere as a function of time because of the transverse component of their velocity relative to the Sun. The proper motion $\mu$ is thus an angular velocity, e.g., measured in milliarcseconds per year (mas/yr or $''/{\rm year}$). This angular velocity is linked to the tangential velocity component via

\begin{align*}
    v_t = d\mu = 4.74\left(\frac{d}{1\,{\rm pc}}\right) \left(\frac{\mu}{1''\,{\rm year^{-1}}}\right) ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Therefore, one can calculate the tangential velocity from the proper motion and the distance. If the latter is derived from the trigonometric parallax, these can be combined to yield

\begin{align*}
    v_t = d\mu = 4.74 \left(\frac{\mu}{1\,''\,{\rm year^{-1}}}\right) \left(\frac{p}{1''}\right)^{-1} ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Of course, the proper motion has two components, corresponding to the absolute value of the angular velocity and its direction on the sphere. Together with $v_r$ this determines the three-dimensional velocity vector. Correcting for the known velocity of the Earth around the Sun, one can then compute the velocity vector v of the star relative to the Sun, called the heliocentric velocity.

{\noindent}\textbf{Moving cluster parallax ($<200\,{\rm pc}$)}: The stars in an (open) star cluster all have a very similar spatial velocity. This implies that their proper motion vectors should be similar. To what accuracy the proper motions are aligned depends on the angular extent of the star cluster on the sphere. Like two railway tracks that run parallel but do not appear parallel to us, the vectors of proper motions in a star cluster also do not appear parallel. They are directed towards a convergence point, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:clusterparallax}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={right,top},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{The moving cluster parallax is a projection effect, similar to that known from viewing railway tracks. The directions of velocity vectors pointing away from us seem to converge and intersect at the convergence point. The connecting line from the observer to the convergence point is parallel to the velocity vector of the star cluster. Image taken from Schneider (2006).}}
    \label{fig:clusterparallax}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/extragalactic/ClusterParallax.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}We consider a star cluster and assume that all stars have the same spatial velocity $v$. The position of the i-th star as a function of time is then described by

\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{r}_i(t) = \mathbf{r}_i(t) + \mathbf{v}t ~ [{\rm m}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\mathbf{r}_i$ is the current position if we identify the origin of time, $t=0$, with `today'. The direction of a star relative to us is described by the unit vector

\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{n}_i(t) \equiv \frac{\mathbf{r}_i}{\lvert\mathbf{r}_i\rvert} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}From this, one infers that for large times, $t\rightarrow\infty$, the direction vectors of the convergence point are identical for all stars in the cluster,

\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{n}_i(t) \rightarrow \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\lvert\mathbf{v}\rvert} \equiv \mathbf{n}_\mathrm{conv} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Hence for large times all stars will appear at the same point $\mathbf{n}_\mathrm{conv}$: the convergence point. This only depends on the direction of the velocity vector of the star cluster. In other words, the direction vector of the stars is such that they are all moving towards the convergence point. Thus, $\mathbf{n}_\mathrm{conv}$ (and hence $\mathbf{v}/\lvert\mathbf{v}\rvert$) can be measured from the direction of the proper motions of the stars in the cluster. On the other hand, one component of $\mathbf{v}$ can be determined from the (easily measured) radial velocity $\mathbf{v}_r$. With these two observables the three-dimensional velocity vector $\mathbf{v}$ is completely determined, as is easily demonstrated: let $\theta$ be the angle between the line-of-sight $\mathbf{n}$ towards a star in the cluster and $\mathbf{v}$. The angle is directly read off from the direction vector $\mathbf{n}$ and the convergence point, $\cos\theta = \mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{v}/\lvert\mathbf{v}\rvert = \mathbf{}_\mathrm{conv}\cdot\mathbf{n}$. With $v\equiv\lvert\mathbf{v}\rvert$ one then obtains

\begin{align*}
    v_r = v\cos\theta ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}], ~~~~~ v_t = v\sin\theta ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and so

\begin{align*}
    v_t = v_r\tan\theta ~ [{\rm m\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This means that the tangential velocity $\mathbf{v}_t$ can be measured without determining the distance to the stars in the cluster. On the other hand, we have a relation between the proper motion, the distance, and $\mathbf{v}$. Hence, a distance determination for the star is now possible with

\begin{align*}
    \mu = \frac{v_t}{d} = \frac{v_r\tan\theta}{d} \rightarrow d = \frac{v_r\tan\theta}{\mu} ~ [{\rm pc}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This method yields accurate distance estimates of star clusters within $\sim200\,{\rm pc}$. The accuracy depends on the measurability of the proper motions. Furthermore, the cluster should cover a sufficiently large area on the sky for the convergence point to be well defined. For the distance estimate, one can then take the average over a large number of stars in the cluster if one assumes that the spatial extent of the cluster is much smaller than its distance to us.

{\noindent}\textbf{Main sequence fitting}: Most stars in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) are located along the main sequence. This enables us to compile a calibrated main sequence of those stars whose trigonometric parallaxes are measured, thus with known distances. Utilizing photo- metric methods, it is then possible to derive the distance to a star cluster. 

{\noindent}The stars of a star cluster define their own main sequence; since they are all located at the same distance, their main sequence is already defined in a CMD in which only apparent magnitudes are plotted. This cluster main sequence can then be fitted to a calibrated main sequence by a suitable choice of the distance, i.e., by adjusting the distance modulus $m-M$,

\begin{align*}
    m-M = 5\log(d/{\rm pc}) - 5 ~ [{\rm mag}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $m$ and $M$ denote the apparent and absolute magnitude, respectively.

{\noindent}In reality this method cannot be applied so easily since the position of a star on the main sequence does not only depend on its mass but also on its age and metallicity. Furthermore, only stars of luminosity class V (i.e., dwarf stars) define the main sequence, but without spectroscopic data it is not possible to determine the luminosity class.

{\noindent}\textbf{Extinction and reddening}: Another major problem is extinction. Absorption and scattering of light by dust affect the relation of absolute to apparent magnitude: for a given $M$, the apparent magnitude $m$ becomes larger (fainter) in the case of absorption, making the source appear dimmer. Also, since extinction depends on wavelength, the spectral energy distribution of the source is modified and the observed colour of the star changes. Because extinction by dust is always associated with such a change in colour, one can estimate the absorption -- provided one has sufficient information on the intrinsic colour of a source or of an ensemble of sources.

{\noindent}We consider the equation of radiative transfer for pure absorption or scattering:

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\mathrm{d}I_\nu}{\mathrm{d}s} = -\alpha_\nu I_\nu ~ [\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-3}\,ster^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $I_\nu$ is the specific intensity at frequency $\nu$, $\alpha_\nu$ is the absorption coefficient, and $s$ is the distance along the light beam.

{\noindent}This says that the amount by which the intensity of a light beam is diminished on a path of length $\mathrm{d}s$ is $\mathrm{d}s$. The absorption coefficient $\alpha_\nu$ is thus defined as the constant of proportionality. In other words, on the distance interval $\mathrm{d}s$, a fraction $\alpha_\nu\mathrm{d}s$ of all photons at frequency $\nu$ is absorbed or scattered out of the beam. The solution of the transport equation is obtained by writing it in the form $\mathrm{d}\ln I_\nu=\mathrm{d}I_\nu/I_\nu=-\alpha_\nu\mathrm{d}s$ and integrating from $0$ to $s$,

\begin{align*}
    \ln I_\nu(s)-\ln I_\nu(0) = -\int\limits_0^s \alpha_\nu(s')\mathrm{d}s \equiv \tau_\nu(s) ~ [\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,ster^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where in the last step we defined the optical depth, $\tau_\nu$, which depends on frequency. This yields

\begin{align*}
    I_\nu(s) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu(s)} ~ [\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,ster^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The specific intensity is thus reduced by a factor $e^{-\tau}$ compared to the case of no absorption taking place. Because of the relation between flux and magnitude $m=-2.5\log S+{\rm const}$ or $S\propto 10^{-0.4m}$, one has

\begin{align*}
    \frac{I_\nu}{I_{\nu,0}} = 10^{-0.4(m-m_0)} = e^{-\tau_\nu} = 10^{-\log(e)\tau_\nu} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}or,

\begin{align*}
    A_\nu &\equiv m-m_0 = -2.5\log(I_\nu/I_{\nu,0}) ~ [{\rm mag}] \\
          &= 2.5\log(e)\tau_\nu ~ [{\rm mag}] \\
          &= 1.086\tau_\nu ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Here, $A_\nu$ is the extinction coefficient describing the change of apparent magnitude $m$ compared to that without absorption, $m_0$. Since the absorption coefficient $\alpha_\nu$ depends on frequency, absorption is always linked to a change in colour. This is described by the colour excess which is defined as follows:

\begin{align*}
    E(X-Y) \equiv A_X-A_Y = (X-X_0)-(Y-Y_0) = (X-Y)-(X_0-Y_0) ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The color excess describes the change of the color index $(X-Y)$, measured in two filters $X$ and $Y$ that define the corresponding spectral windows by their transmission curves. The ratio $A_X/A_Y=\tau_{\nu(X)/\tau_{\nu(Y)}}$ depends only on the optical properties of the dust or, more specifically, on the ratio of the absorption coefficients in the two frequency bands $X$ and $Y$ considered here. Thus, the color excess is proportional to the extinction coefficient,

\begin{align*}
    E(X-Y) = A_X-A_Y = A_X\left(1-\frac{A_Y}{A_X}\right) \equiv A_XR_X^{-1} ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where in the last step we introduced the factor of proportionality $R_X$ between the extinction coefficient and the colour excess, which depends only on the properties of the dust and the choice of the filters. Usually, one considers a blue and a visual filter and writes

\begin{align*}
    A_V = R_V E(B-V) ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}For example, for dust in our Milky Way we have the characteristic relation

\begin{align*}
    A_{V,\mathrm{MWG}} = (3.1\pm0.1)E(B-V) ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This relation is not a universal law, but the factor of proportionality depends on the properties of the dust. They are determined, e.g., by the chemical composition and the size distribution of the dust grains. Figure \ref{fig:extinctioncurve} shows the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient for different kinds of dust, corresponding to different values of $R_V$ . In the optical part of the spectrum we have approximately $\tau_\nu\propto\nu$, i.e., blue light is absorbed (or scattered) more strongly than red light. The extinction therefore always causes a reddening.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \floatbox[{\capbeside\thisfloatsetup{capbesideposition={right,top},capbesidewidth=4cm}}]{figure}[\FBwidth]
    {\caption{\footnotesize{Wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient $A_\nu$, normalized to the extinction coefficient $A_I$ at $\lambda=9000$\,\AA$ = 0.9\,\mu$m.

    \label{fig:extinctioncurve}}
    {\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/extragalactic/ExtinctionCurve.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The extinction coefficient $A_V$ is proportional to the optical depth towards a source and so is the colour excess. Since the extinction is due to dust along the line-of-sight, the colour excess is proportional to the column density of dust towards the source. If we assume that the dust-to-gas ratio in the interstellar medium does not vary greatly, we expect that the column density of neutral hydrogen $N_\mathrm{H}$ is proportional to the colour excess. The former can be measured from the Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption in the spectra of stars, whereas the latter is obtained by comparing the observed colour of these stars with the colour expected for the type of star, given its spectrum (and thus, its spectral classification). One finds indeed that the color excess is proportional to the HI column density with

\begin{align*}
    E(B-V) = 1.7 \left(\frac{N_\mathrm{H}}{10^{22}\,{\rm atoms\,cm^{-2}}}\right) ~ [{\rm mag}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and a scatter of about 30\% around this relation. The fact that this scatter is so small indicates that the assumption of a constant dust-to-gas ratio is reasonable.

{\noindent}In the Solar neighborhood the extinction coefficient for sources in the disk is about

\begin{align*}
    A_V \approx \frac{d}{1\,{\rm kpc}} ~ [{\rm mag}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}but this relation is at best a rough approximation, since the absorption coefficient can show strong local deviations from this law, for instance in the direction of molecular clouds.

{\noindent}\textbf{Colour-colour diagram}: As a first step in this measurement, it is necessary to determine the degree of extinction, which can only be done by analyzing the reddening. The stars of the cluster are plotted in a color-color diagram, for example by plotting the colors $(U-B)$ versus $(B-V)$. A colour-colour diagram also shows a main sequence along which the majority of the stars are aligned. The wavelength-dependent extinction causes a reddening in both colors. This shifts the positions of the stars in the diagram. The direction of the reddening vector depends only on the properties of the dust and is here assumed to be known, whereas the amplitude of the shift depends on the extinction coefficient. In a similar way to the CMD, this amplitude can now be determined if one has access to a calibrated, unreddened main sequence for the colour-colour diagram which can be obtained from the examination of nearby stars. From the relative shift of the main sequence in the two diagrams one can then derive the reddening and thus the extinction. The essential point here is the fact that the colour-colour diagram is \textit{independent of the distance}.

{\noindent}This then defines the procedure for the distance determination of a star cluster using photometry: in the first step we determine the reddening $E(B-V)$, and thus also $A_V$ via $A_V=(3.1\pm0.1)E(B-V)$ for the Galactic medium, by shifting the main sequence in a colour-colour diagram along the reddening vector until it matches a calibrated main sequence. In the second step the distance modulus is determined by vertically (i.e., in the direction of $M$) shifting the main sequence in the CMD until it matches a calibrated main sequence. From this, the distance is finally obtained according to

\begin{align*}
    m-M = 5\log\left(\frac{d}{1\,{\rm pc}}\right)-5+A ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}\textbf{Spectroscopic distance}: From the spectrum of a star, the spectral type as well as its luminosity class can be obtained. The former is determined from the strength of various absorption lines in the spectrum, while the latter is obtained from the width of the lines. From the line width the surface gravity of the star can be derived, and from that its radius (more precisely, $M/R2^2$). The spectral type and the luminosity class specify the position of the star in the HRD unambiguously. By means of stellar evolution models, the absolute magnitude $M_V$ can then be determined. Furthermore, the comparison of the observed colour with that expected from theory yields the color excess $E(B-V)$, and from that we obtain $A_V$. With this information we are then able to determine the distance using

\begin{align*}
    m_V-A_V-M_V = 5\log\left(\frac{d}{1\,{\rm pc}}\right)-5 ~ [{\rm mag}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}\textbf{Visual binaries}: Kepler’s third law for a two-body problem,

\begin{align*}
    P = \sqrt{\frac{4\pi^2}{G(m_1+m_2)}a^3} ~ [{\rm yr}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}relates the orbital period $P$ of a binary star to the masses $m_i$ of the two components and the semi-major axis $a$ of the ellipse. The latter is defined by the separation vector between the two stars in the course of one period. This law can be used to determine the distance to a visual binary star. For such a system, the period $P$ and the angular diameter $2\theta$ of the orbit are direct observables. If one additionally knows the mass of the two stars, for instance from their spectral classification, $a$ can be determined according to Kepler's third law, and from this the distance follows with the small angle approximation $d=a/\theta$.

{\noindent}\textbf{Variable stars}: Several types of pulsating stars show periodic changes in their brightnesses, where the period of a star is related to its mass, and thus to its luminosity. This period-luminosity (PL) relation is ideally suited for distance measurements: since the determination of the period is independent of distance, one can obtain the luminosity directly from the period if the calibrated PL-relation is known. The distance is thus directly derived from the measured magnitude using the photometric distance, if the extinction can be determined from color measurements.

{\noindent}The existence of a relation between the luminosity and the pulsation period can be expected from simple physical considerations. Pulsations are essentially radial density waves inside a star that propagate with the speed of sound, $c_s$. Thus, one can expect that the period is comparable to the sound crossing time through the star, $P\sim R/c_s$. The speed of sound $c_s$ in a gas is of the same order of magnitude as the thermal velocity of the gas particles, so that $k_BT\sim m_pc_s^2$, where $m_p$ is the proton mass (and thus a characteristic mass of particles in the stellar plasma) and $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant. According to the virial theorem, one expects that the gravitational binding energy of the star is about twice the kinetic (i.e., thermal) energy, so that for a proton,

\begin{align*}
    \frac{GMm_p}{R} \sim k_BT.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Combining these relations, we obtain for the pulsation period

\begin{align*}
    P\sim\frac{R}{c_s}\sim\frac{R\sqrt{m_p}}{\sqrt{k_BT}} \sim\frac{R^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}} \propto \langle\rho\rangle^{-1/2},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\langle\rho\rangle$ is the mean density of the star. This is a remarkable result -- the pulsation period depends only on the mean density. Furthermore, the stellar luminosity is related to its mass by approximately $L/M^3$. If we now consider stars of equal effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ (where $L\propto R^2T_\mathrm{eff}^4$), we find that

\begin{align*}
    P \propto \frac{R^{3/2}}{\sqrt{M}} \propto L^{7/12},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}which is the relation between period and luminosity that we were aiming for.

{\noindent}One finds that a well-defined period-luminosity relation exists for three types of pulsating stars:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\delta$ Cepheid stars (classical Cepheids). These are young stars found in the disk population (close to the Galactic plane) and in young star clusters.
    \item W Virginis stars, also called population II Cepheids. These are low-mass, metal-poor stars located in the halo of the Galaxy, in globular clusters, and near the Galactic center.
    \item RR Lyrae stars. These are likewise population II stars and thus metal-poor. They are found in the halo, in globular clusters, and in the Galactic bulge.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}\textbf{Globular clusters}: 

{\noindent}\textbf{Tully-Fisher relation}: Using $21\,{\rm cm}$ observations of spiral galaxies, in 1977 R. Brent Tully and J. Richard Fisher found that the maximum rotation velocity of spirals is closely related to their luminosity, following the relation

\begin{align*}
    L_\mathrm{TF} \propto v_\mathrm{max}^\alpha ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the power-law index (i.e., the slope) of the Tully-Fisher relation is about $\alpha\sim4$. The larger the wavelength of the filter in which the luminosity is measured, the smaller the dispersion of the Tully-Fisher relation (see Figure \ref{fig:tullyfisher}). This is to be expected because radiation at larger wavelengths is less affected by dust absorption and by the current star formation rate, which may vary to some extent between individual spirals. Furthermore, it is found that the value of $\alpha$ increases with the wavelength of the filter: The Tully-Fisher relation is steeper in the red, which follows from the fact that more massive, or more luminous galaxies (i.e., those with larger $v_\mathrm{,ax}$) are redder. The dispersion of galaxies around this relation in the NIR (e.g., in the H-band) is about 10\%.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}Because of this close correlation, the luminosity of spirals can be estimated quite precisely by measuring the rotational velocity. The determination of the (maximum) rotational velocity is independent of the galaxy’s distance. By comparing the luminosity, as determined from the Tully-Fisher relation, with the measured flux, one can then estimate the distance of the galaxy -- without utilizing the Hubble relation!

{\noindent}The measurement of $v_\mathrm{max}$ is obtained either from a spatially resolved rotation curve, by measuring $v_\mathrm{rot}$, which can be done with optical spectroscopy or, for relatively nearby galaxies, also with spatially resolved $21\,{\rm cm}$ spectroscopy. Alternatively, one can observe an integrated spectrum of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line of HI that has a Doppler width corresponding to about $2v_\mathrm{max}$ (see Fig.3.28). The Tully-Fisher relation shown in Figure \ref{fig:tullyfisher} was determined by measuring the width of the $21\,{\rm cm}$ line.

    {\includegraphics[width=8cm]{figures/extragalactic/21cm_vrot.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The shapes of the rotation curves of spirals are very similar to each other, in particular with regard to their flat behavior in the outer part. The flat rotation curve implies

\begin{align*}
    M = \frac{v_\mathrm{max}^2R}{G} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where the value of the distance $R$ from the center of the galaxy is chosen to be in the range of the flat part of the rotation curve (i.e., where $v_\mathrm{rot}(R)\approx v_\mathrm{max}$). We note that the exact value of $R$ is not important; of course, $M=M(R)$. By re-writing this,

\begin{align*}
    L = \left(\frac{M}{L}\right)^{-1} \frac{v_\mathrm{max}^2R}{G} ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and by replacing $R$ by the mean surface brightness $\langle I\rangle=L/R^2$, we obtain

\begin{align*}
    L = \left(\frac{M}{L}\right)^{-2} \left(\frac{1}{G^2\langle I\rangle}\right)v_\mathrm{max}^4 ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}This is the Tully-Fisher relation if $M/L$ and $\langle I\rangle$ are the same for all spirals. The latter is in fact suggested by Freeman’s law. Since the shapes of rotation curves for spirals seem to be very similar, the radial dependence of the ratio of luminous to dark matter may also be quite similar among spirals. Furthermore, since the mass- to-light ratios of a stellar population as measured from the red or infrared emission do not depend strongly on its age, independently of their Hubble type. Within $R_{25}$ one finds $M/L_B=6.2$ for Sa's, $4.5$ for Sb's, and $2.6$ for Sc's. This trend does not come as a surprise because late types of spirals contain more young, blue and luminous stars.

{\noindent}\textbf{Faber-Jackson relation}: A relation for elliptical galaxies, analogous to the Tully-Fisher relation, was found by Sandra Faber and Roger Jackson. They discovered that the velocity dispersion in the center of ellipticals, $\sigma_v$, scales with luminosity,

\begin{align*}
    L_\mathrm{FJ} \propto \sigma_v^4 ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}`Deriving' the Faber-Jackson scaling relation is possible under the same assumptions as for the Tully-Fisher relation. However, the dispersion of ellipticals about this relation is larger than that of spirals about the Tully-Fisher relation.

{\noindent}\textbf{$D_n-\sigma$ relation}: Another scaling relation for ellipticals which is of substantial importance in practical applications is the $D_n-\sigma$ relation. $D_n$ is defined as the mean diameter of an ellipse within which the average surface brightness. It corresponds to a value of $20.75\,{\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$ in the B-band. If we now assume that all ellipticals have a self-similar brightness profile, $I(R)=I_ef(R/R_r)$, with $f(1)=1$, then the luminosity within $D_n$ can be written as

\begin{align*}
    I_n\left(\frac{D_n}{2}\right)^2\pi &= 2\pi I_e \int\limits_0^{D_n/2} Rf(R/R_e)\mathrm{d}R \\
    &= 2\pi I_eR_e^2 \int\limits_0^{D_n/(2R_e)} ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,m^{-2}}] xf(x)\mathrm{d}x,
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where in the last step we changed the integration variable to $x=R/R_e$. For a de Vaucouleurs profile we have approximately $f(x)\propto x^{-1.2}$ in the relevant range of radius. Computing the integral with this expression, we obtain

\begin{align*}
    D_n \propto R_eI_e^{0.8}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Empirically, we find that ellipticals follow the normalized $D_n-\sigma$ relation

\begin{align*}
    D_n = 2.05\times\left(\frac{\sigma_v}{100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}}\right) ~ [{\rm kpc}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and they scatter around this relation with a relative width of about 15\%.

\subsection{Question 4}

What evidence is there that most galaxies contain nuclear black holes? How do those black holes interact with their host galaxies?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Evidence for most galaxies containing a SMBH includes: mass estimates using stellar orbital velocities in galaxy centers, strong non-thermal relativistic X-ray emission, and hypervelocity stars. Galaxies with a bulge component host a SMBH whose mass is tightly correlated with the properties of the stellar component suggesting that the SMBH evolves with its host galaxy. The BH directly affects their host galaxies through feedback processes. Accretion of material onto the SMBH powers a relativistic jet of material which can heat the surrounding gas and quench star formation. 

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The Milky Way harbors a black hole (BH) in its center. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that the energy for the activity of AGNs is generated by accretion onto a BH. Thus, the question arises as to whether all (or most) galaxies contain a super-massive black hole (SMBH) in their nuclei. Indeed, SMBHs are very abundant. This result then instigates further questions: what distinguishes a `normal' galaxy from an AGN if both have a SMBH in the nucleus? Is it the mass of the black hole, the rate at which matter is accreted onto it, or the efficiency of the mechanism which is generating the energy?

{\noindent}What is a BH? A technical answer is that a BH is the simplest solution of Einstein’s theory of general relativity which describes the gravitational field of a point mass. Less technically (though sufficient for our needs) we may say that a BH is a point mass, or a compact mass concentration, with an extent smaller than its Schwarzschild radius $r_S$.

{\noindent}The first discussion of BHs can be traced back to Laplace in 1795, who considered the following: if one reduces the radius $r$ of a celestial body of mass $M$, the escape velocity $v_\mathrm{esc}$ at its surface,

\begin{align*}
    v_\mathrm{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}} ~ [{\rm km\,s^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}will increase. As a thought experiment, one can now see that for a sufficiently small radius, $v_\mathrm{esc}$ will be equal to the speed of light, $c$. This happens when the radius decreases to

\begin{align*}
    r_S \equiv \frac{2GM}{c^2} = 2.95\left(\frac{M}{{\rm M_\odot}}\right) ~ [{\rm km}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The radius $r_S$ is named the Schwarzschild radius, after Karl Schwarzschild who, in 1916, discovered the point-mass solution of Einstein's field equations. For our purpose we will define a BH as a mass concentration with a radius smaller than $r_S$. As we can see, $r_S$ is very small: about $3\,{\rm km}$ for the Sun, and $\sim10^{12}\,{\rm cm}$ for the SMBH in the Galactic center. At a distance of $R_0=8\,{\rm kpc}$, this corresponds to an angular radius of $\sim8\times10^{-6}\,{\rm arcsec}$. Current observing capabilities are still far from resolving scales of order $r_S$, except for the VLBI technique which currently comes close to it: the highest angular resolution currently achieved with millimeter-VLBI is a mere factor of $\sim10$ away from resolving the Schwarzschild radius for the Galactic BH that is supposed to coincide with the compact radio source Sgr A$^*$. By performing VLBI studies at sub-millimeter wavelengths in the near future, we may actually be able to `see' the Schwarzschild radius of a BH for the first time. The largest observed velocities of stars in the Galactic center,   $\sim5000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}\ll c$, indicate that they are still well away from the Schwarzschild radius. Relativistic effects are directly observed in AGNs and that velocities close to $c$ do in fact occur there -- which again is a very direct indication of the existence of a SMBH.

{\noindent}If even for the closest SMBH, the one in the GC, the Schwarzschild radius is significantly smaller than the achievable angular resolution, how can we hope to prove that SMBHs exist in other galaxies? Like in the GC, this proof has to be found indirectly by detecting a compact mass concentration incompatible with the mass concentration of the stars observed.

{\noindent}We consider a mass concentration of mass $M_\bullet$ in the center of a galaxy where the characteristic velocity dispersion of stars (or gas) is $\sigma_v$. We compare this velocity dispersion with the characteristic velocity (e.g., the Kepler rotational velocity) around a SMBH at a distance $r$, given by $\sqrt{GM_\bullet/r}$. From this it follows that, for distances smaller than

\begin{align*}
    r_\mathrm{BH} = \frac{GM_\bullet}{\sigma_v^2} \sim 0.4\left(\frac{M_\bullet}{10^6\,{\rm M_\odot}}\right)\left(\frac{\sigma_v}{100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{-2} ~ [{\rm pc}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}the SMBH will significantly affect the kinematics of stars and gas in the galaxy. The corresponding angular scale is

\begin{align*}
    \theta_\mathrm{BH} = \frac{r_\mathrm{BH}}{d} \sim 0.1\left(\frac{M_\bullet}{10^6\,{\rm M_\odot}}\right) \left(\frac{\sigma_v}{100\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{-2} \left(\frac{d}{1\,{\rm Mpc}}\right)^{-1} ~ [{\rm arcsec}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $d$ is the distance of the galaxy. From this we immediately conclude that our success in finding SMBHs will depend heavily on the achievable angular resolution. The HST enabled scientists to make huge progress in this field. The search for SMBHs promises to be successful only in relatively nearby galaxies. In addition, we can see that for increasing distance $d$ the mass $M$  has to increase for a SMBH to be detectable at a given angular resolution.

{\noindent}The presence of a SMBH inside $r_\mathrm{BH}$ is revealed by an increase in the velocity dispersion for $r<r_\mathrm{BH}$, which should then behave as  $\sigma_v\propto r^{-1/2}$ for $r\lesssim r_\mathrm{BH}$. If the inner region of the galaxy rotates, one expects, in addition, that the rotational velocity $v_\mathrm{rot}$ should also increase inwards $\propto r^{-1/2}$.

The small rectangle depicts the position of the slit used by the STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) instrument on-board the HST to obtain a spectrum of the central region. The spectral shape of five emission lines, as obtained from this long-slit spectrum, is shown in the right-hand panel; the position along the slit is plotted vertically, the relative wavelength change of the light (which is proportional to the radial velocity) horizontally, also illustrated by colors. Near the center of the galaxy the wavelength suddenly changes because the rotational velocity steeply increases inwards and then changes sign on the other side of the center. This shows the Kepler rotation in the central gravitational field of a SMBH, whose mass can be estimated as $M_\bullet \sim 3\times10^8\,{\rm M_\odot}$.

    \label{fig:m84hst}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The practical problems in observing a SMBH have already been mentioned above. One problem is the angular resolution. To measure an increase in the velocities for small radii, the angular resolution needs to be better than $\theta_\mathrm{BH}$. Furthermore, projection effects play a role because only the velocity dispersion of the projected stellar distribution, weighted by the luminosity of the stars, is measured. Added to this, the kinematics of stars can be rather complicated, so that the observed values for $\sigma_v$ and $v_\mathrm{rot}$ depend on the distribution of orbits and on the geometry of the distribution.

{\noindent}Despite these difficulties, the detection of SMBHs has been achieved in recent years, largely due to the much improved angular resolution of optical telescopes (like the HST) and to improved kinematic models. Black hole masses were determined for more than $70$ nearby galaxies, and upper limits on $M_\bullet$ were obtained for about $30$ galaxies.

Figure \ref{fig:m84hst} shows an example for the kinematical method discussed in the previous section. A long-slit spectrum across the nucleus of the galaxy M84 clearly shows that, near the nucleus, both the rotational velocity (seen by the mean wavelength of the emission line) and the velocity dispersion (given by the width of the line) change; both increase dramatically towards the center.

    \label{fig:bhcorrelations}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Currently, strong indications for SMBHs have been found in the kinematics of stars or gas, resolving the sphere of influence of the black hole, in more than $70$ nearby galaxies, and their masses have been estimated. This permits us to examine whether, and in what way, $M_\bullet$ is related to the properties of the host galaxy. In this way, a remarkable correlation was discovered: one finds that $M_\bullet$ is correlated with the absolute magnitude of the bulge component (or the spheroidal component) of the galaxy in which the SMBH is located (see Figure \ref{fig:bhcorrelations}, upper left panel). Here, the bulge component is either the bulge of a spiral or $S0$ galaxy or an elliptical galaxy as a whole. This correlation is described by

\begin{align*}
    M_\bullet = 1.7\times10^9\left(\frac{L_\mathrm{V}}{10^{11}\,{\rm L_{V_\odot}}}\right)^{1.11} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}and indicated by the dotted line in the upper left panel of Figure \ref{fig:bhcorrelations}. The correlation is statistically highly significant, but the deviations of the data points from this power law are considerably larger than their error bars, with a scatter of about a factor $3$ at high luminosities, increasing towards fainter galaxies. Instead of the bulge luminosity, one can also study the correlation of $M_\bullet$ with the mass of the bulge, which is plotted in the upper right panel of Figure \ref{fig:bhcorrelations}, and for which the best power-law fit

\begin{align*}
    M_\bullet = 2.9\times10^8\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{bulge}}{10^11\,{\rm M_\odot}}\right)^{1.05} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}is obtained. For the $M_\bullet(M_\mathrm{bulge})$ relation, the scatter is slightly smaller than around the $M_\bullet(L_\mathrm{V})$ relation. Given that the power-law index in the latter is almost unity, we can rewrite this relation in the form

\begin{align*}
    M_\bullet \approx 3\times10^{-3}M_\mathrm{bulge}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Thus we find that the BH mass is strongly correlated with the stellar properties of the host galaxy, and that the ratio of black hole mass and bulge mass is approximately $1/300$. In other words, 0.3\% of the baryon mass that was used to make the stellar population in the bulge of these galaxies was transformed into a central black hole.

{\noindent}An even tighter correlation exists between $M_\bullet$ and the velocity dispersion in the bulge component, as can be seen in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:bhcorrelations}. This relation is best described by

\begin{align*}
    M_\bullet = 2.1\times 10^8\left(\frac{\sigma_v}{200\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{5.64} ~ [{\rm M_\odot}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}Fitting early- and late-type galaxies separately (shown by the red and blue lines in the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:bhcorrelations}), the slope of the scaling relation becomes slightly flatter ($5.2$ and $5.06$, respectively), with a normalization for the early-type galaxies being larger by about a factor $2$ than that for late-type galaxies. Since the velocity dispersion in late-type galaxies is smaller than that for early-types, the difference in the normalization of the $M_\bullet(\sigma_v)$ relation between these two galaxy populations is responsible for the steeper slope of the combined power-law fit. The scatter of the $M_\bullet(\sigma_v)$ relation is smaller than those of the scaling relations with mass and luminosity, about a factor of $2.5$, and the scatter decreases slightly with increasing  $\sigma_v$.

{\noindent}Hence we conclude that galaxies with a bulge component host a SMBH, whose mass is tightly correlated with the properties of the stellar component; in particular, the BH mass amounts to about 0.3\% of the stellar mass in the bulge component.

{\noindent}There have been claims in the literature that even globular clusters contain a BH; however, these claims are not undisputed. In addition, there may be objects that appear like globular clusters, but are in fact the stripped nucleus of a former dwarf galaxy. In this case, the presence of a central BH is not unexpected, provided the scaling relations holds down to very low velocity dispersion.

{\noindent}To date, the physical origin of this very close relation has not been understood in detail. The most obvious apparent explanation (that in the vicinity of a SMBH with a very large mass the stars are moving faster than around a smaller-mass SMBH) is not correct: the mass of the SMBH is significantly less than one percent of the mass of the bulge component. This is in contrast to the previously discussed case where the kinematics of the stars and gas were measured within the sphere of influence -- but the size of this is much smaller than the bulge component itself. We can therefore disregard the contribution of the SMBH to the gravitational field in which the stars are orbiting, except in the very inner region. Instead, this correlation has to be linked to the fact that the spheroidal component of a galaxy evolves together with the SMBH. A better understanding of this relation can only be found from models of galaxy evolution.

{\noindent}For very massive halos, the suppression of cooling flows in galaxy clusters is due to AGN activity of the central galaxy in the cluster. Since (almost) all massive galaxies contain a SMBH, this kind of feedback may be operational not only in groups and clusters, but actually in individual massive galaxies as well. In particular, there is a great deal of evidence for a relation between nuclear starbursts in galaxies and AGN activity. The gas needed for a starburst in the center of a galaxy is also potential fuel for the central BH. The details of this process are quite uncertain, but with plausible prescriptions, the cut-off of the luminosity function at $L\gtrsim L^*$ can be successfully modeled.

{\noindent}Feedback by an AGN can occur in several ways. In the case of galaxy clusters, the major effect of the AGN is the insertion of hot bubbles into the ICM through radio jets. The AGNs in most central cluster galaxies are not very luminous, and seem to be in the `radio mode' of low accretion rate. Thus, for low accretion rates, the main channel of feedback is the injection of mechanical energy into the surrounding gas. At high accretion rates, in the `quasar mode', the main source of feedback is presumably heating of the gas. Furthermore, the strong radiation field from quasars changes the ionization structure of the surrounding gas, which affects its cooling curve and at low temperatures actually leads to radiative heating.

    \item Does heating from AGN affect star formation in the outer parts of the disk?
    \item How are SMBHs formed?

\subsection{Question 5}

Define and describe globular clusters. Where are they located? What are their typical ages, and how is this determined?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Globular clusters are much more massive stellar systems, containing $10^4-10^6$ stars in a nearly spherical distribution located within the galactic halo. Globular clusters do not contain gas, dust, or young stars. The stellar density in the center of a globular cluster is extremely high: a typical value is $10^4\,{\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}}$, compared with $0.05\,{\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}}$ in the solar neighborhood. Most globular clusters are at a distance of $r\lesssim35\,{\rm kpc}$ (with $r=\sqrt{R^2+z^2}$) from the Galactic center, but some are also found at $r>60\,{\rm kpc}$. At these distances it is hard to judge whether these objects are part of the Galaxy or whether they have been captured from a neighboring galaxy, such as the Magellanic Clouds. Their typical ages are $\sim10\,{\rm Gyrs}$ which is determined using their main sequence turnoff point.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Our Galaxy contains about $150$ globular clusters, but large elliptical galaxies such as M87 can contain as many as $10,000$. It is a mystery why young globular clusters are largely absent in our Galaxy but common in many others, such as M31, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and galaxies that have undergone recent mergers. Unlike open clusters, the Galaxy's globular clusters are old, and are believed to be relics of the formation of the Galaxy itself. The metallicity appears to be the same for all the stars in a given cluster (presumably because the cluster formed from a well-mixed gas cloud) but different clusters have a wide range of metallicity, from only $0.005\,{\rm Z_\odot}$ to nearly solar. The spatial distribution and the kinematics of a group of clusters are correlated with the metallicity, and for many purposes the clusters in our Galaxy can be divided into two groups: a roughly spherical population that contains 80\% of the clusters, shows little or no rotation and has metallicity $Z<0.1\,{\rm Z_\odot}$, and is associated with the stellar halo; and a flattened population that contains the remaining 20\%, has $Z>0.1\,{\rm Z_\odot}$, exhibits rapid rotation, and is associated with the disk and bulge. This bimodal distribution of metallicities is present in the globular cluster systems of other galaxies as well.

{\noindent}Because globular clusters have strong or high central concentration (the central density is much larger than the mean density) three different measures of the radius are usually quoted for globular clusters: the core radius, where the surface brightness has fallen to half its central value; the median or half-light radius, the radius of a sphere that contains half of all the luminosity; and the limiting or tidal radius, the outer limit of the cluster where the density drops to zero. Typical values of these and other cluster parameters are given in Table 1.3.

\end{table}

{\noindent}The visible halo of our Galaxy consists of about 150 globular clusters and field stars with a high velocity component perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Even at about 150, the number of known globular clusters is relatively small. A globular cluster is a collection of typically several hundred thousand stars, contained within a spherical region of radius   $\sim20\,{\rm pc}$. The stars in the cluster are gravitationally bound and orbit in the common gravitational field. The old globular clusters with $[Fe/H]<-0.8$ have an approximately spherical distribution around the Galactic center. A second population of globular clusters exists that contains younger stars with a higher metallicity, $[Fe/H]>-0.8$. They have a more oblate geometrical distribution and are possibly part of the thick disk because they show roughly the same scale-height.

{\noindent}The density distribution of metal-poor globular clusters and field stars in the halo is described by

\begin{align*}
    n(r)\propto r^{-\gamma} ~ [{\rm Mpc^3}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}with a slope $\gamma$ in the range $3-3.5$.

    \centering
    \caption{A schematic side view of the Milky Way. Figure taken from Sparke (2007).}
    \label{fig:mwgschematic}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The number of globular clusters is higher in early types and in more luminous galaxies. The specific abundance of globular clusters in a galaxy is defined as their number, normalized to a galaxy of absolute magnitude $M_V=-15$. This can be done by scaling the observed number $N_t$ of globular clusters in a galaxy of visual luminosity $L_V$ or absolute magnitude $M_V$, respectively, to that of a fiducial galaxy with $M_V$ corresponding to a luminosity of $L_V=L_{15}$:

\begin{align*}
    S_N = N_t\frac{L_{15}}{L_V} = N_t10^{0.4(M_V+15)} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}If the number of globular clusters were proportional to the luminosity (and thus roughly to the stellar mass) of a galaxy, then this would imply a constant $S_N$ . However, this is not the case: For Sa's and Sb's we find $S_N\sim1.2$, whereas $S_N\sim0.5$ for Sc's. $S_N$ is larger for ellipticals and largest for cD galaxies.

{\noindent}There have been claims in the literature that even globular clusters contain a black hole; however, these claims are not undisputed. In addition, there may be objects that appear like globular clusters, but are in fact the stripped nucleus of a former dwarf galaxy. In this case, the presence of a central black hole is not unexpected.

{\noindent}Historically, measuring globular cluster (GC) ages has been a major driver to refine stellar evolution models and bring them to the best possible state of the art. The same applies to GC observations, both photometrically (especially with HST) and spectroscopically, thus submitting stellar models to more and more stringent observational checks. Indeed, with GC ages a strict lower limit on the age of the Universe was at stake, and for quite some time in the 1980s they have been an embarrassment for the young, matter dominated Universe many were advocating at the time. Indeed, GC ages contributed to keeping open the door to a cosmological constant (or some equivalent to it) prior to the unambiguous discovery of the universal acceleration. Now, at the time of the precision/concordance cosmology, the age of the Universe issue appears to be solved, and as a side benefit we can be quite confident on the reliability of stellar evolution models, that never indicated GC ages significantly below 12 Gyr.

{\noindent}The mainstream method to measure absolute globular cluster ages relies of the relation between the luminosity of the main sequence turnoff of theoretical isochrones, the age, and chemical composition. In turn, the absolute visual magnitude of the turnoff is given by $m_\mathrm{TO} - M_\mathrm{TO} = 5\log(d)-5$, where $m_\mathrm{TO}$ (the turnoff apparent magnitude corrected for extinction) is the directly observable quantity.

Describe three different methods used in the determination of the mass of a galaxy cluster.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Three methods used in the determination of the mass of a galaxy cluster includes: the virial theorem, hot ICM X-ray gas, and gravitational lensing.

\subsubsection{Additional context} 

{\noindent}\textbf{Virial equilibrium}: 

{\noindent}\textbf{X-ray gas}: This gas temperature is a measure for the depth of the cluster's potential well, since the hotter the gas is, the deeper the potential well has to be to prevent the gas from escaping via evaporation.

{\noindent}\textbf{Gravitational lensing}: Utilizes the fact that light is deflected in a gravitational field. The angle through which light rays are bent due to the presence of a massive object depends on the mass of that object.

\subsection{Question 7}

What is the density-morphology relation for galaxies? How is that related to what we know about the relationship between galaxy density and star formation rates in galaxies?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

The density-morphology relation for galaxies is the relation between the density of galaxies and the likelihood of a particular galaxy morphology. In galaxy clusters, for example, elliptical galaxies are more commonly found in the high-density cluster centers whereas spirals are more commonly found at the lower density galaxy outskirts.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The mixture of galaxy types in clusters seems to differ from that of isolated (field) galaxies. Whereas about 70\% of luminous field galaxies are spirals, clusters are dominated by early-type galaxies, in particular in their inner regions. Furthermore, the fraction of spirals in a cluster depends on the distance from the center and increases for larger $r$. Obviously, the local density has an effect on the morphological mix of galaxies. As in clusters, the fraction of group members which are spirals is lower than the fraction of spirals among field (i.e., isolated) galaxies, and the relative abundance of spiral galaxies decreases with increasing $\sigma_v$ of the group.

{\noindent}More generally, one may ask whether the mixture of the galaxy population depends on the local galaxy density. While earlier studies of this effect were frequently confined to galaxies within and around clusters, extensive redshift surveys like the 2dFGRS and the SDSS allow us to systematically investigate this question with very large and carefully selected samples of galaxies. The morphological classification of such large samples is performed by automated software tools, which basically measure the light concentration in the galaxies, or, alternatively, the best-fitting S\'ersic-index $n$. A comparison of galaxies classified this way with visual classifications shows very good agreement.

{\noindent}As an example of such an investigation, results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are shown in Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology}. Galaxies were morphologically classified, based on SDSS photometry, and separated into four classes, corresponding to elliptical galaxies, S0 galaxies, and early (Sa) and late (Sc) types of spiral. In this analysis, only galaxies were included for which the redshift was spectroscopically measured. Therefore, the spatial galaxy density can be estimated. However, one needs to take into account the fact that the measured redshift is a superposition of the cosmic expansion and the peculiar velocity of a galaxy. The peculiar velocity may have rather large values ($1,000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$), in particular in clusters of galaxies. For this reason, for each galaxy in the sample the surface number density of galaxies which have a redshift within $1,000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ of the target galaxy was determined. The left panel in Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology} shows the fraction of the different galaxy classes as a function of this local galaxy density. A very clear dependence, in particular of the fraction of late-type spirals, on the local density can be seen: in regions of higher galaxy density Sc-spirals contribute less than 10\% of the galaxies, whereas their fraction is about 30\% in low-density regions. Combined, the fraction of spirals decreases from 65\% in the field to about 35\% in regions of high galaxy density. In contrast, the fraction of ellipticals and S0 galaxies increases towards higher densities, with the increase being strongest for ellipticals.

    \label{fig:densitymorphology}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}In the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology}, the mixture of galaxy morphologies is plotted as a function of the distance to the center of the nearest cluster, where the distance is scaled by the virial radius of the corresponding cluster. As expected, a very strong dependence of the fraction of ellipticals and spirals on this distance is seen. Sc spirals contribute a mere 5\% of galaxies in the vicinity of cluster centers, whereas the fraction of ellipticals and S0-galaxies strongly increases inwards.

{\noindent}The two diagrams in Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology} are of course not mutually independent: a region of high galaxy density is very likely to be located in the vicinity of a cluster center, and the opposite is valid accordingly. Therefore, it is not immediately clear whether the mix of galaxy morphologies depends primarily on the respective density of the environment of the galaxies, or whether it is caused by morphological transformations in the inner regions of galaxy clusters.

{\noindent}The density-morphology relation is also seen in galaxy groups. The fraction of late-type galaxies decreases, and the fraction of early-type galaxies increases with decreasing distance from the group center, as is also the case in clusters. When considering the morphological mix of visually classified early- and late-type galaxies, averaged over the whole group or cluster (i.e., up to the virial radius) then it seems to be constant for group/cluster halo masses in excess of $\sim10^{13}\,{\rm M_\odot}$.

{\noindent}A closer examination of Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology} may provide a clue as to what physical processes are responsible for the dependence of the morphological mix on the local number density. We consider first the right-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology}. Three different regimes in radius can be identified: for $R\gtrsim R_\mathrm{vir}$, the fraction of the different galaxy types remains basically constant. In the intermediate regime, $0.3\lesssim R/R_\mathrm{vir}\lesssim1$, the fraction of S0 galaxies strongly increases inwards, whereas the fraction of late-type spirals decreases accordingly. This result is compatible with the interpretation that in the outer regions of galaxy clusters spirals lose gas, for instance by their motion through the intergalactic medium (IGM), and these galaxies then transform into passive S0 galaxies. Below $R\lesssim0.3\,R_\mathrm{vir}$, the fraction of S0 galaxies decreases strongly, and the fraction of ellipticals increases substantially.

{\noindent}In fact, the ratio of the number densities of S0 galaxies and ellipticals, for $R\lesssim0.3\,R_\mathrm{vir}$, strongly decreases as $R$ decreases. This may hint at a morphological transformation in which S0 galaxies are turned into ellipticals, probably by collisions or mergers. Such gas-free mergers, also called `dry mergers', may be the preferred explanation for the generation of elliptical galaxies. One of the essential properties of dry mergers is that such a merging process would not be accompanied by a burst of star formation, unlike the case of gas-rich collisions of galaxies. The existence of a population of newly born stars in ellipticals would be difficult to reconcile with the generally old stellar population actually observed in these galaxies.

{\noindent}Considering now the dependence on local galaxy density (the left-hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:densitymorphology}), a similar behavior of the morphological mix of galaxies is observed: there seems to exist two characteristic values for the galaxy density where the relative fractions of galaxy morphologies change noticeably. Interestingly, the relation between morphology and density seems to evolve only marginally between $z=0.5$ and the local Universe.

{\noindent}One clue as to the origin of the morphological transformation of galaxies in clusters, as a function of distance from the cluster center, comes from the observation that the velocity dispersion of very bright cluster galaxies seems to be significantly smaller than that of less luminous ones. Assuming that the mass-to-light ratio does not vary substantially among cluster members, this then indicates that the most massive galaxies have smaller velocity dispersions. One way to achieve this trend in the course of cluster evolution is by dynamical interactions between cluster galaxies. Such interactions tend to `thermalize' the velocity distribution of galaxies, so that the mean kinetic energy of galaxies tends to become similar. This then causes more massive galaxies to become slower on average. If this interpretation holds, then the morphology-density relation may be attributed to these dynamical interactions, rather than to the (so-called ram-pressure) stripping of the ISM as the galaxies move through the ICM. However, ram-pressure stripping of the ISM has been clearly observed in clusters. This effect mostly acts on the atomic gas of spirals, whereas the molecular gas seems to be less affected; we recall that the molecular gas is more densely concentrated towards the galactic disk, and thus more strongly bound. In fact, it has been known for a long time that there are spiral galaxies in groups and clusters which are deficient in neutral hydrogen, relative to field galaxies of the same stellar luminosity. If ram-pressure stripping, or other effects in the dense cluster environment, removes the ISM from spirals, then the result could be a disk galaxy without ongoing star formation -- something that may resemble an S0 galaxy. If that were the case, than S0s would be passively fading former spirals. Whereas the original spirals satisfied the Tully-Fisher relation, the S0s would then be expected to be considerably fainter than spirals, at fixed rotational velocity; this indeed is the case.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}The light of normal galaxies originates from stars. Stellar evolution is largely understood, and the spectral radiation of stars can be calculated from the theory of stellar atmospheres. If the distribution of the number density of stars is known as a function of their mass, chemical composition, and evolutionary stage, we can compute the light emitted by them. The theory of population synthesis aims at interpreting the spectrum of galaxies as a superposition of stellar spectra. We have to take into account the fact that the distribution of stars changes over time; e.g., massive stars leave the main sequence after several $10^6\,{\rm yr}$, the number of luminous blue stars thus decreases, which means that the spectral distribution of the population also changes in time. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy thus reflects its history of star formation (SF) and stellar evolution. For this reason, simulating different SF histories and comparing them with observed galaxy spectra provides important clues for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Let's discuss some aspects of the theory of population synthesis; this subject is of tremendous importance for our understanding of galaxy spectra.

{\noindent}The processes of SF are not understood in detail; for instance, it is currently impossible to compute the mass spectrum of a group of stars that jointly formed in a molecular cloud. Obviously, high-mass and low-mass stars are born together and form young (open) star clusters. The mass spectra of these stars are determined empirically from observations.

{\noindent}The initial mass function (IMF) is defined as the initial mass distribution at the time of birth of the stars, such that $\xi(m)\mathrm{d}m$ specifies the fraction of stars in the mass interval of width $\mathrm{d}m$ around $m$, where the distribution is normalized,

\begin{align*}
    \int\limits_{m_L}^{m_U} m\xi(m)\,\mathrm{d}m = 1\,{\rm M}_\odot.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The integration limits are not well defined. Typically, one uses $m_L=0.1\,{\rm M_\odot}$ because stars less massive than $\approx0.08\,{\rm M_\odot}$ do not ignite their hydrogen (and are thus brown dwarfs), and $m_U\sim100\,{\rm M_\odot}$ because considerably more massive stars are not observed. Whereas such very massive stars would in any case be difficult to observe because of their very short lifetime, the theory of stellar structure tells us that more massive stars can probably not form a stable configuration due to excessive radiation pressure. The shape of the IMF is also subject to uncertainties; in most cases, the Salpeter-IMF is used,

\begin{align*}
    \xi(m) \propto m^{-2.35} ~ [{\rm dimensionless}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}as obtained from investigating the stellar mass spectrum in young star clusters. It is by no means clear whether a universal IMF exists, or whether it depends on specific conditions like metallicity, the mass of the galaxy, cosmic epoch, or other parameters. Given the difficulties of determining the shape of the IMF, apparent variations of the IMF with epoch or environment may be attributed to other effect, such as the specifics of the star-formation history in galaxies. Therefore, there seems to be no clear direct indication that the IMF varies with environment. However, some properties of high-redshift galaxies are very difficult to understand if their IMF was the same as in our neighborhood. It has therefore been suggested that the IMF in starbursts is different from that of quiescent star formation such as we are experiencing in the Milky Way.

{\noindent}The Salpeter-IMF seems to be a good description for stars with $M\gtrsim1\,{\rm M_\odot}$, whereas the IMF for less massive stars is flatter. Note that, due to the steep slope of the IMF, most of the stellar mass is contained in low-mass stars. However, since the luminosity of main-sequence stars depends strongly on mass, approximately as $L\propto M^3$, most of the luminosity comes from high-mass stars.

{\noindent}The star-formation rate (SFR) is the gas mass that is converted into stars per unit time,

\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{SFR} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}M_\mathrm{gas}}{\mathrm{d}t} ~ [{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}].
\end{align*}

{\noindent}The metallicity $Z$ of the ISM defines the metallicity of the newborn stars, and the stellar properties in turn depend on $Z$. During stellar evolution, metal-enriched matter is ejected into the ISM by stellar winds, planetary nebulae, and SNe, so that $Z(t)$ is an increasing function of time. This chemical enrichment must be taken into account in population synthesis studies in a self-consistent form.

{\noindent}Let $S_{\lambda,Z}(t')$ be the emitted energy per wavelength and time interval, normalized to an initial total mass of $1\,{\rm M_\odot}$, emitted by a group of stars of initial metallicity $Z$ and age $t_0$. The function $S_{\lambda,Z(t-t_0)}(t')$, which describes this emission at any point $t$ in time, accounts for the different evolutionary tracks of the stars in the (HRD). It also accounts for their initial metallicity (i.e., at time $t-t'$), where the latter follows from the chemical evolution of the ISM of the corresponding galaxy. Then the total spectral luminosity of this galaxy at a time $t$ is given by

\begin{align*}
    F_\lambda(t) = \int\limits_0^t \mathrm{SFR}(t-t')S_{\lambda,Z(t-t')}(t')\,\mathrm{d}t' ~ [{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}thus by the convolution of the star formation rate with the spectral energy distribution of the stellar population. In particular, $F_\lambda(t)$ depends on the star formation history.

    \label{fig:stellarspectra}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}In the beginning, the spectrum and luminosity of a stellar population are dominated by the most massive stars, which emit intense UV radiation. But after $\sim10^7\,{\rm yr}$, the flux below $1,000$\,\AA\,is diminished significantly, and after $\sim10^8\,{\rm yr}$, it hardly exists any more. At the same time, the flux in the NIR increases because the massive stars evolve into red supergiants.

{\noindent}For $10^8\,{\rm yr}\gtrsim t\gtrsim10^9\,{\rm yr}$, the emission in the NIR remains high, whereas short-wavelength radiation is more and more diminished. After $\sim10^9\,{\rm yr}$, red giant stars (RGB stars) account for most of the NIR production. After $\sim3\times10^9\,{\rm yr}$, the UV radiation increases again slightly, due to blue stars on the horizontal branch into which stars evolve after the AGB phase, and due to white dwarfs which are hot when they are born. Between an age of $4$ and $13$ billion years, the spectrum of a stellar population evolves fairly little. 

{\noindent}Of particular importance is the spectral break located at about $4,000$\,\AA which becomes visible in the spectrum after a few $10^7\,{\rm yr}$. This break is caused by a strongly changing opacity of stellar atmospheres at this wavelength, mainly due to strong transitions of singly ionized calcium and the Balmer lines of hydrogen. This $4,000$\,\AA break is one of the most important spectral properties of the continuum stellar emission in galaxies; it allows us to estimate the redshifts of early-type galaxies from their photometric properties -- so-called photometric redshift estimates.

\subsection{Question 9}

How are galaxy redshifts estimated by photometric techniques?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Well-defined spectral features are typically used for photometric redshift measurements since the location of these breaks in wavelength depends directly on the redshift. The most common breaks include the $4000$\,\AA~break (from ionized metals in stellar photospheres) and the $1216$\,\AA~Lyman break (from neutral hydrogen in the IGM along the line-of-sight).

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The Lyman-break technique is a special case of a method for estimating the redshift of galaxies (and QSOs) by multi-color photometry. This technique can be employed due to the spectral breaks at $912\,$\AA and $1216\,$\AA, respectively. Spectra of galaxies also show other characteristic features. The broadband energy distribution is basically a superposition of stellar radiation (if we ignore for a moment the presence of dust, which can yield a substantial infrared emission from galaxies). A stellar population of age $\gtrsim10^8\,{\rm yr}$ features a $4,000$\,\AA~break because, due to a sudden change in the opacity at this wavelength, the spectra of most stars show such a break at about $4,000$\,\AA~(see Figure \ref{fig:sedsf}). Hence, the radiation from a stellar population at $<4,000$\,\AA~is less intense than at $>4,000$\,\AA; this is the case particularly for early-type galaxies, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:stellarspectra}, due to their old stellar population.

{\noindent}If we assume that the star-formation histories of galaxies are not too diversified, the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies are expected to follow certain patterns. For example, if all galaxies had a single episode of star formation, starting at their formation redshift $z_f$ and lasting for a time $t$, then the spectra of these galaxies, for a given initial mass function, would be characterized by these two parameters, as well as the total stellar mass formed; this latter quantity then yields the amplitude of the spectrum, but does not affect the spectral shape. When measuring the magnitude of these galaxies in $n$ broad-band filters, we can form $n-1$ independent colors. Next suppose we form a multidimensional CCD, in which every galaxy is represented by a point in this ($n-1$)-dimensional color space. Considering only galaxies at the present epoch, all these points will lie on a two-dimensional surface in this multi-dimensional space, instead of being more or less randomly distributed.

{\noindent}Next, instead of plotting $z=0$ galaxies, we consider the distribution of galaxies at some higher redshift $z<z_f$. This distribution of points will be different, mainly due to two different effects. First, a given photometric filter corresponds to a different rest-frame spectral range of the galaxy, due to redshift. Second, the ages of the stellar populations are younger at an earlier cosmic epoch, and thus the spectral energy distributions are different. Both of these effects will cause these redshift $z$ galaxies to occupy a different two-dimensional surface in multi-color space.

{\noindent}Generalizing this argument further, we see that in this idealized consideration, galaxies will occupy a three-dimensional subspace in ($n-1$)-dimensional color space, parametrized by formation redshift $z_f$, time-scale $t$, and the galaxy’s redshift $z$. Hence, from the measurement of the broad-band energy distribution of a galaxy, we might expect to be able to determine, or at least estimate, its redshift, as well as other properties such as the age of its stellar population; this is the principle of the method of photometric redshifts.

    {\caption{\footnotesize{The bottom panel illustrates again the principle of the drop-out method, for a galaxy at $z\sim3.2$. Whereas the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorbs part of the spectral flux between (rest-frame wavelength) $912$ and $1216$\,\AA, the flux below $912$\,\AA~vanishes almost completely. By using different combinations of filters (top panel), an efficient selection of galaxies at other redshifts is also possible. The example shows a galaxy at $z=1$ whose $4,000$\,\AA~break is located between the two redder filters. The $4,000$\,\AA~break occurs in stellar populations after several $10^7\,{\rm yr}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:sedsf}) and is one of the most important features for the method of photometric redshift.

    {\includegraphics[width=11cm]{figures/extragalactic/PhotRedshifts.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Of course, the situation is considerably more complicated in reality. Galaxies most likely have a more complicated SF history than assumed here, and hence they will not be confined to a two-dimensional surface at fixed redshift, but instead will be spread around this surface. The spectrum of a stellar population also depends on its metallicity, as well as absorption, either by gas and dust in the ISM or hydrogen in intergalactic space (of which the Lyman-break method makes proper use). On the other hand, the colors of current-day galaxies are remarkably similar, best indicated by the red sequence. Therefore, the method of photometric redshifts may be expected to work, even if more complications are accounted for than in the idealized example considered above.

{\noindent}The method is strongly aided if the galaxies have characteristic spectral features, which shift in wavelength as the redshift is changed. If, for example, the spectrum of a galaxy was a power law in wavelength, then the redshifted spectrum would as well be a power law, with the same spectral slope -- if we ignore the different age of the stellar population. Therefore, for such an SED is would be impossible to estimate a redshift. However, if the spectrum shows a clear spectral break, then the location of this break in wavelength depends directly on the redshift, thus yielding a particularly clean diagnostic. In this context the $4,000$\,\AA~break and the Ly$\alpha$-break play a central role, as is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:photredshifts}.

{\noindent}In order to apply this method, one needs to find the characteristic domains in color space where (most of) the galaxies are situated. This can be done either empirically, using observed SEDs of galaxies, or by employing population synthesis models. More precisely, a number of standard spectra of galaxies (so-called templates) are used, which are either selected from observed galaxies or computed by population synthesis models. Each of these template spectra can then be redshifted in wavelength. For each template spectrum and any redshift, the expected galaxy colors are determined by integrating the spectral energy distribution, multiplied by the transmission functions of the applied filters, over wavelength. This set of colors can then be compared with the observed colors of galaxies, and the set best resembling the observation is taken as an estimate for not only the redshift but also the galaxy type.

{\noindent}The advantage of this method is that multi-color photometry is much less time-consuming than spectroscopy of galaxies. Whereas some modern spectrographs allow one to take spectra of $\sim1,000$ objects simultaneously, images taken with wide-field cameras of $1\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ on $4\,{\rm m}$ class telescopes record the fluxes of $10^5$ galaxies in a one hour exposure. In addition, this method can be extended to much fainter magnitudes than are achievable for spectroscopic redshifts. The disadvantage of the method becomes obvious when an insufficient number of photometric bands are available, since then the photometric redshift estimates can yield a completely wrong $z$; these are often called catastrophic outliers. One example for the occurrence of extremely wrong redshift estimates is provided by a break in the spectral energy distribution. Depending of whether this break is identified as the Lyman-break or the $4,000$\,\AA~break, the resulting redshift estimates will be very different. To break the corresponding degeneracy, a sufficiently large number of filters spread over a broad spectral range must be available to probe the spectral energy distribution over a wide range in wavelengths. As a general rule, the more photometric bands are available and the smaller the uncertainties in the measured magnitudes, the more accurate the estimated redshift. Normally, data from four or five photometric bands are required to obtain useful redshift estimates. In particular, the reliability of the photometric redshift benefits from data over a large wavelength range, so that a combination of several optical and NIR filters is desirable.

{\noindent}The successful application of this method also depends on the type of the galaxies. Early-type galaxies form a relatively well-defined color-magnitude sequence at any redshift, due to their old stellar populations (manifested in clusters of galaxies in form of the red cluster sequence), so that the redshift of this type of galaxy can be estimated very accurately from multi-color information. However, this is only the case if the $4,000$\,\AA~break is located in between two of the applied filters. For $z\sim1$ this is no longer the case if only optical filters are used. Other types of galaxies show larger variations in their spectral energy distribution, depending, e.g., on the star formation history, as mentioned before.

{\noindent}Photometric redshifts are particularly useful for statistical purposes, for instance in situations in which the exact redshift of each individual galaxy in a sample is of little relevance. However, by using a sufficient number of optical and NIR filters, quite accurate redshift estimates for individual galaxies are achievable. For example, with eight optical and NIR bands and accurate photometry, a redshift accuracy of  $\Delta z\sim0.03(1+z)$ was obtained, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:photvsspecredshift} by a comparison of photometric redshifts with redshifts determined spectroscopically for galaxies in the field of the HDF-North. If data in additional photometric bands are available, e.g., using filters of smaller transmission curves (`intermediate width filters'), the redshift accuracy can be increased even more, e.g., $\Delta z\sim0.01(1+z)$ was obtained using a total of 30 photometric bands.

\subsection{Question 10}

Draw a spectrum of a high-redshift quasar. What do quasar emission lines typically look like? Explain what we see in the spectrum at rest wavelengths bluer than $1216$ Angstroms.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Answer.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

{\noindent}The first quasars (for `quasi-stellar radio source') were discovered  as `radio galaxies with no galaxy'. They appeared point-like in optical photographs; only their enormous redshifts betrayed that they were not Galactic stars. Rather, they were gigaparsecs distant, and hence extremely luminous. Subsequently `radio-quiet' quasars, called quasi-stellar objects, or QSOs, were found by searching for objects that appeared stellar, but emitted too strongly at infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths relative to their brightness in visible light. Radio-quiet QSOs outnumber radio-loud quasars by at least a factor of 30; both are now believed to be variants of the same type of object, so we use the term `quasar' to include the QSOs. In the 1980s, deep images of nearby quasars showed us that they were in fact the bright nuclei of galaxies, so luminous as to outshine the surrounding stars. Most astronomers now regard quasars as more powerful versions of a Seyfert nucleus. Quasars cover a very wide range in luminosity; the most powerful are also the rarest.

{\noindent}Quasars are the most luminous members of the class of AGNs. The optical and ultraviolet spectrum of a quasar typically shows strong broad emission lines characteristic of moderately dense gas (Figure \ref{fig:qsoradioquiet}). The widths of the lines correspond to the Doppler shifts expected from emitting gas travelling at speeds $\sim10,000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. These emitting clouds are moving much faster than the galaxy's stars, which typically orbit at a few hundred kilometers per second. Many AGN are variable, changing their luminosity substantially within a few months, days, or even hours. The emission lines also strengthen and decline, within a few days or weeks. To allow such fast variability, both broad lines and continuum radiation must come from a region no more than a few light-weeks across.

    \label{fig:qsoradioquiet}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}Interestingly, the flux of the source varies at nearly all frequencies, where the variability time-scale differs among the objects and also depends on the wavelength. As a rule, it is found that the variability time-scale of the observed radiation is smaller, and its amplitude larger, at higher frequencies. The optical spectrum is very blue; most quasars at redshifts $z\lesssim2$ have $(U-B)<-0.3$ (for comparison, only hot white dwarfs have a similarly blue color index). Besides this blue continuum, very broad emission lines are characteristic of the optical and UV spectrum. Some of them correspond to transitions of very high ionization energy.

{\noindent}The continuum spectrum of a quasar can often be described, over a broad frequency range, by a power law of the form

\begin{align*}
    S_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha},
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\alpha$ is the spectral index. A spectral index of $\alpha-0$ corresponds to a flat spectrum, whereas $\alpha=1$ describes a spectrum in which the same energy is emitted in every logarithmic frequency interval. Incidentally, the energy distribution seen in Fig \ref{fig:qsoradioquiet} corresponds approximately to the latter case, over more than ten orders of magnitude in frequency, although over smaller frequency ranges, the spectral shape differs markedly from $\alpha=1$.

    \label{fig:diffusebackground}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Figure \ref{fig:diffusebackground} shows the spectrum of cosmic background radiation, plotted as $\nu I_\nu$ versus wavelength so that the curve shows the intensity per logarithmic frequency interval. Following the terminology of the CMB, these are called background radiation as well. However, the name should not imply that it is a background radiation of cosmological origin, in the same sense as the CMB. The neutrino background that should be present as a relic from the early epochs of the Universe, in the form of a thermal distribution of all three neutrino families with $T\approx1.9\,{\rm K}$, is likely to remain undiscovered for quite some time due to the very small cross section of these low energy neutrinos.

{\noindent}In the present context, we simply denote the flux in a specific frequency domain, averaged over sky position at high Galactic latitudes, as background radiation. Thus, when talking about e.g., the optical background, we refer to the sum of the radiation of all galaxies and AGNs per solid angle. The interpretation of such a background radiation depends on the sensitivity and the angular resolution of the telescopes used. Imagine, for instance, observing the sky with an optical camera that has an angular resolution of only one arcminute. A relatively isotropic radiation would then be visible at most positions in the sky, featuring only some very bright or very large sources. Thus, the background can be decomposed into a `resolved' component, which can be attributed to individually identified sources, and the unresolved component. On improving the angular resolution, more and more individual sources become visible, so that a larger fraction of the background radiation is resolved. At optical wavebands, the Hubble Deep Fields have resolved essentially all of the background into individual sources. In analogy to this, one may wonder whether the CXB or the CIB can likewise be understood as a superposition of radiation from discrete sources.

{\noindent}\textbf{Cosmic gamma-ray background (CGB)}: Mostly from blazars (beamed synchrotron radiation.).

{\noindent}\textbf{Cosmic x-ray background (CXB)}: The first X-ray experiment in astronomy, a balloon flight in 1962, discovered a diffuse X-ray emission across the sky, confirmed by the first X-ray satellites which discovered not only a number of extragalactic X-ray sources (such as AGNs and clusters of galaxies), but also an apparently isotropic radiation component. The spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is a very hard (i.e., flat) power law, cut off at an energy above $40\,{\rm keV}$, which can roughly be described by

\begin{align*}
    I_\nu \propto E^{-0.3}\exp\left(-\frac{E}{E_0}\right),
\end{align*}

{\noindent}with $E_0\sim40\,{\rm keV}$. 

{\noindent}Initially, the origin of this radiation was unknown, since its spectral shape was different from the spectra of sources that were known at that time. For example, it was not possible to obtain this spectrum by a superposition of the spectra of known AGNs. ROSAT, with its substantially improved angular resolution compared to earlier satellites (such as the Einstein observatory), conducted source counts at much lower fluxes, based on some very deep images. From this, it was shown that at least 80\% of the CXB in the energy range between $0.5$ and $2\,{\rm keV}$ is emitted by discrete sources, of which the majority are AGNs. Hence it is natural to assume that the total CXB at these low X-ray energies originates from discrete sources, and observations by XMM-Newton and Chandra have confirmed this.

{\noindent}However, the X-ray spectrum of normal AGNs is different from that seen by the CXB, namely it is considerably steeper(about $S_\nu\propto\nu^{-S0.7}$). Therefore, if these AGNs contribute the major part of the CXB at low energies, the CXB at higher energies cannot possibly be produced by the same AGNs. Subtracting the spectral energy of the AGNs found by ROSAT from the CXB spectrum, one obtains an even harder spectrum, resembling very closely that of thermal bremsstrahlung. Therefore, it was supposed for a long time that the CXB is, at higher energies, produced by a hot intergalactic gas at temperatures of $k_BT\sim30\,{\rm keV}$. This model was excluded, however, by the precise measurement of the thermal spectrum of the CMB by COBE, showing that the CMB has a perfect blackbody spectrum. If a postulated hot intergalactic gas were able to produce the CXB, it would cause significant deviations of the CMB from the Planck spectrum, namely by the inverse Compton effect (the same effect that causes the SZ effect in clusters of galaxies). Thus, the COBE results clearly ruled out this possibility.

{\noindent}Deep observations with Chandra and XMM (e.g., in the CDFS) have finally resolved most of the CXB also at higher energies. From source counts performed in such fields, more than 75\% of the CXB in the energy range of $2\,{\rm keV}<E<10\,{\rm keV}$ could be resolved into discrete sources. Again, most of these sources are AGNs, but typically with a significantly harder (i.e., flatter) spectrum than the AGNs that are producing the low-energy CXB. Such a flat X-ray spectrum can be produced by photoelectric absorption of an intrinsically steep power law spectrum, where photons closer to the ionization energy are more efficiently absorbed than those at higher energy. According to the classification scheme of AGNs, these are Type 2 AGNs, thus Seyfert 2 galaxies and QSOs with strong intrinsic self-absorption. We should recall that Type 2 QSOs have only been detected by Chandra -- hence, it is no coincidence that the same satellite has also been able to resolve the high-energy CXB.

{\noindent}However, at even higher energies most of the CXB was still unaccounted for -- even the observed Type-2 AGNs could not account for it. It thus seems that there is a population of sources in the Universe which dominate the X-ray emission at high energies, still escape the observations at low X-ray frequencies. These could be heavily obscured AGNs, where only the hard X-rays manage to escape the emitting region. With the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite, a significant number of such heavily obscured AGNs were found. Their estimated number density, together with their spectral energy distribution, make it plausible that they are the missing population of `hidden black holes' responsible for the hard CXB.

{\noindent}\textbf{Cosmic optical/ultraviolet background (CUVOB)}: Thermal emission from stars.

{\noindent}\textbf{Cosmic infrared background (CIB)}: The first point to note from Figure \ref{fig:diffusebackground} is the relatively flat energy distribution between the UV- and the mm-regime. Since both the UV-radiation and the far-IR radiation originate almost entirely from star-formation, the flat energy distribution implies that essentially half of the energetic photons emitted from newly-formed stars are absorbed by dust and reradiated in the FIR. Hence, estimates of the star formation activity from UV-flux alone will on average be biased low by 50\%. Observations of background radiation in the infrared are very difficult to accomplish, in particular due to the thermal radiation from the instruments and the zodiacal light. However, the DIRBE and FIRAS instruments onboard COBE provided a measurement of the CIB. The question now is whether the CIB can be understood as well as being due solely to individual sources.

{\noindent}Since mid- and far-IR observations are only possible from space, finding the answer to that question is challenging. Infrared observatories in space have a rather small aperture which, together with the long wavelength, yields a rather large point-spread function (PSF). This implies that when one observes to low flux limits, where the mean angular separation of sources on the sky becomes comparable to the size of the PSF, these sources can not be separated. This yields a lower flux limit for the detection of individual sources, called the confusion limit. The smaller the telescope, the shallower is the confusion limit reached. For example, the flux limit down to which individual sources could be identified with the Spitzer satellite at $160\,\mu{\rm m}$ corresponds to only 7\% of the CIB at this wavelength. The much larger mirror on the Herschel satellite lowered the confusion limit such that individual sources can be identified which account for about 52\% of the CIB. Going to larger wavelength, the confusion limit is even more severe.

{\noindent}However, one can dig deeper into the source counts with a technique called stacking. Taking the position of sources detected at some smaller wavelength (where the confusion limit is fainter), and adding up the flux in the longer wavelength band around all these positions, one obtains the mean long-wavelength flux of these sources. With this method, one will miss all fainter sources which do not have a detected counterpart in the short-wavelength input catalog, so that wavelength should be selected carefully. Given the characteristic spectrum of FIR-bright sources, one expects that most of the sources radiating in the FIR will have an appreciable flux at $24\,\mu{\rm m}$. Since Spitzer was particularly sensitive at this wavelength, the corresponding source catalog is best for a stacking analysis. Furthermore, if the redshifts of the sources selected at $24\,\mu{\rm m}$ is known, the stacking analysis can be used to determine the redshift distribution of the contributions to the CIB in the FIR. With stacking, the source counts can be followed to about three times lower flux than the confusion limit of individual sources permits.

{\noindent}\textbf{Cosmic microwave background (CMB)}: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a remnant of the early hot phase of the Universe, namely thermal radiation from the time before recombination. 

{\noindent}\textbf{Cosmic radio background (CRB)}: Synchrotron radiation, quasars, radio supernovae, and star forming galaxies.

\subsection{Question 12}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

A wide range of objects are subsumed under the name AGN, all of which have in common strong non-thermal emission in the core of a galaxy (host galaxy). It is important to keep in mind that the frequency range in which sources are studied affects the source classification. The classification of AGNs is very confusing at first glance. Different classes refer to different appearances of AGNs but do not necessarily correspond to the physical nature of these sources. Similarly, the properties of the emission of AGNs in different wavebands (such as radio or gamma-rays) can differ most strongly. However, the large variety of appearances of AGNs can be understood, at least to a first approximation, by geometric considerations. The emission of an AGN is not isotropic; the flow of material which causes the energy release near the central black hole occurs in the form of a disk (the accretion disk), which defines a pair of preferred directions (i.e., those perpendicular to the plane in which the disk lies). In the context of unified models, the way an AGN appears to us depends strongly on the angle between this disk axis and the line-of-sight to the source.

{\noindent}In Figure \ref{fig:agn}, this geometric picture of an AGN is sketched. The different green arrows indicate different lines-of-sight to observers, and they are labeled with the characteristic AGN class the corresponding observer will see. In the upper half of the figure, it is assumed that the AGN produces strong jets, whereas in the lower part, weaker jets (or none at all) are assumed.\footnote{As is often the case with these figures, this schematic depicts two very different AGN cases -- one with a radio loud jet and one without. No such AGN can have one jet on one side and not the other!} With this picture in mind, we shall now describe the various types of AGNs. Surrounding the central supermassive black hole is an accretion disk which emits the bulk part of the optical and UV continuum emission. The central region around the accretion disk is the source of most of the X-ray radiation. Gas clouds above and below the accretion disk are responsible for the broad emission lines. In the plane of the disk, a distribution of gas and dust is present, which can absorb radiation from the inner region of the AGN; this obscuring material is sometimes depicted as a torus, though its geometry is probably more complicated. Nevertheless, the appearance of the AGN depends on whether the observer is located near the plane of the disk -- where radiation is partly absorbed by the material in the torus -- or placed in a direction closer to the axis of the disk. This concerns in particular the broad line emission, which may be fully obscured for an observer in the plane of the disk. In contrast, the gas responsible for the narrow emission lines is located at much larger distances from the black hole, so that it cannot be fully hidden by the obscuring torus.

    {\caption{\footnotesize{Sketch of our current understanding of the unification of AGN types.

When looking from a direction near the plane of the disk, a direct view of the continuum source and the BLR is blocked, whereas it is directly visible from directions closer to the symmetry axis of the disk. The difference between Seyfert 1 (and BLRG) and Seyfert 2 (and NLRG) is therefore merely a matter of orientation relative to the line-of-sight.

    \label{fig:agn}}
    {\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/extragalactic/AGN.png}}
\end{figure}

{\noindent}The radio jets are launched very close to the central black hole along the direction of the disk axis. The emission from these jets is highly anisotropic, because the velocity in the inner part of the jets is close to the speed of light; then, according to the theory of Special Relativity, the jet emission is strongly beamed in the direction of jet motion. This implies that the appearance of the jet depends on how close the line-of-sight to an observer is to the jet axis. If the jet points almost directly at the observer, the jet emission can outshine all the other radiation from the AGN. 

{\noindent}The QSOs are the most luminous AGNs. Their core luminosity can be as high as a thousand times that of an $L^*$  galaxy. Therefore they can outshine their host galaxy and appear point-like on optical images. For QSOs of lower $L$, their host galaxies were identified and spatially resolved with the HST. According to our current understanding, AGNs are the active cores of galaxies. These galaxies are supposed to be fairly normal galaxies, except for their intense nuclear activity.

{\noindent}The unusually blue color of quasars suggested the possibility of searching for them not only with radio observations but also at optical wavelengths, namely to look for point-like sources with a very blue $U-B$ color index. These photometric surveys were very successful. In fact, many more such sources were found than expected from radio counts. Most of these sources are (nearly) invisible in the radio domain of the spectrum; such sources are called radio-quiet. Their optical properties are virtually indistinguishable from those of quasars. In particular, they have a blue optical energy distribution (of course, since this was the search criterion!), strong and broad emission lines, and in general a high redshift.

{\noindent}Apart from their radio properties, these sources appear to be like quasars. Therefore they were called radio-quiet quasars, or quasi-stellar objects, QSOs. Today this terminology is no longer very common because the clear separation between sources with and without radio emission is not considered valid any more. Radio-quiet quasars also show radio emission if they are observed at sufficiently high sensitivity. In modern terminology, the expression QSO encompasses both the quasars and the radio-quiet QSOs. About 10 times more radio-quiet QSOs than quasars are thought to exist.

{\noindent}In fact, there is as yet not a clear consensus in whether QSOs show a bimodal distribution in their ratio of radio-to-optical luminosity. Figure \ref{fig:qsoradiovsoptical} shows several different samples of AGN; in particular, optically-selected QSOs from the Palomar-Green survey (filled stars) and radio-loud QSOs (open circles). It seems that the ratio between radio and optical luminosity falls into two broad ranges, with a clear gap in between. Therefore, diagrams like that argue in favor of a bimodal distribution. However, this apparent division into two classes can at least partly be attributed to selection effects: the distribution of the radio-to-optical flux ratio depends on the selection of the QSO sample. Obviously, selecting them by their radio emission will favor those with a large $L_\mathrm{radio}/L_\mathrm{opt}$ ratio. Furthermore, the fraction of QSOs for which this ratio is large (i.e., which would be termed as radio-loud QSOs) depends on optical luminosity and on redshift: One finds a significantly higher radio-loud fraction amongst more luminous, and lower-redshift QSOs.

\subsection{Question 13}

What are galaxy clusters? What are their basic properties (eg, mass, size). List and explain three ways they can be detected.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Clusters of galaxies are gravitationally bound systems of a hundred or more galaxies in a volume of diameter $\sim2\,{\rm h^{-1}\,Mpc}$ with masses of $\sim10^{13}-10^{14}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. Clusters predominantly contain early-type galaxies, so there is not much star formation taking place any more. Some clusters of galaxies seem to be rather circular in projection, others have a highly elliptical or irregular distribution of galaxies; some even have more than one center.

{\noindent}Detection methods include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item X-ray emission. Clusters of galaxies are strong sources of X-ray radiation. They contain hot gas, with temperatures ranging from $10^7$ up to $10^8\,{\rm K}$.
    \item Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The hot X-ray ICM gas inverse Compton scatters CMB photons which appears as a bright spot in the CMB and a deviation from a perfect $2.7\,{\rm K}$ CMB blackbody in that direction.
    \item Weak gravitational lensing. The angle of deflection of a background light source is directly proportional to the intervening mass of the galaxy cluster.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The cluster of galaxies closest to us is the Virgo cluster, at a distance of $18\,{\, Mpc}$; it is a cluster with an irregular galaxy distribution. The closest regular cluster is Coma, at a distance of $90\,{\rm Mpc}$. Coma contains about 1000 luminous galaxies, of which 85\% are early-type galaxies.

{\noindent}In 1933, Fritz Zwicky measured the radial velocities of the galaxies in Coma and found that their distribution around the mean has a dispersion of about $1000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. From the total luminosity of all its galaxies the mass of the cluster can be estimated. If the stars in the cluster galaxies have an average mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) similar to that of our Sun, we would conclude $M=(M_\odot/L_\odot)L$. However, stars in early-type galaxies are on average slightly less massive than the Sun and thus have a slightly higher $M/L$. Thus, the above mass estimate needs to be increased by a factor of $\sim10$.

{\noindent}Zwicky then estimated the mass of the cluster by multiplying the luminosity of its member galaxies with the mass-to-light ratio. From this mass and the size of the cluster, he could then estimate the velocity that a galaxy needs to have in order to escape from the gravitational field of the cluster -- the escape velocity. He found that the characteristic peculiar velocity of cluster galaxies (i.e., the velocity relative to the mean velocity) is substantially larger than this escape velocity. In this case, the galaxies of the cluster would fly apart on a time-scale of about $10^9\,{\rm yr}$ (the time it takes a galaxy to cross through the cluster once) and, consequently, the cluster would dissolve. However, since Coma seems to be a relaxed cluster (i.e., it is in equilibrium and thus its age is definitely larger than the dynamical time scale of $10^9\,{\rm yr}$) Zwicky concluded that the Coma cluster contains significantly more mass than the sum of the masses of its galaxies. Using the virial theorem he was able to estimate the mass of the cluster from the velocity distribution of the galaxies. This was the first clear indicator of the existence of dark matter.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}X-ray satellites later revealed that clusters of galaxies are strong sources of X-ray radiation. They contain hot gas, with temperatures ranging from $10^7$ up to $10^8\,{\rm K}$ (Figure \ref{fig:hydraa}). This gas temperature is another measure for the depth of the cluster's potential well, since the hotter the gas is, the deeper the potential well has to be to prevent the gas from escaping via evaporation. Mass estimates based on the X-ray temperature result in values that are comparable to those from the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies. Whereas the X-ray emitting gas provides a further mass component of ordinary, baryonic matter (in fact, the X-ray emitting gas contains more mass than the stars in the cluster galaxies) the total mass of clusters exceeds that of stars and gas by a factor of about five, thus clearly confirming the hypothesis of the existence of dark matter in clusters (Figure \ref{fig:abell383}). A third method for determining cluster masses, the so-called gravitational lensing effect, utilizes the fact that light is deflected in a gravitational field. The angle through which light rays are bent due to the presence of a massive object depends on the mass of that object. From observation and analysis of the gravitational lensing effect in clusters of galaxies, cluster masses are derived that are in agreement with those from the two other methods. Therefore, clusters of galaxies are a second class of cosmic objects whose mass is dominated by dark matter.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}Clusters of galaxies are cosmologically young structures. Their dynamical time-scale (i.e., the time in which the mass distribution in a cluster settles into an equilibrium state) is estimated as the time it takes a member galaxy to fully cross the cluster once. With a characteristic velocity of $v\sim1000\,{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a diameter of $R\sim2\,{\rm Mpc}$ one thus finds

\begin{align*}
    t_\mathrm{dyn} \sim \frac{2R}{v} \sim 2\times10^9\,{\rm yr}.
\end{align*}

{\noindent}the Universe is about $14\times10^9\,{\rm yr}$ old. During this time galaxies have not had a chance to cross the cluster many times. Therefore, clusters still contain, at least in principle, information about their initial state. Most clusters have not had the time to fully relax and evolve into a state of equilibrium that would be largely independent of their initial conditions. Comparing this with the time taken for the Sun to rotate around the center of the Milky Way (about $2\times10^8\,{\rm yr}$) galaxies thus have had plenty of time to reach their state of equilibrium.

{\noindent}Besides massive clusters of galaxies there are also galaxy groups, which sometimes contain only a few luminous galaxies. In fact, the number density of groups is far larger than that of clusters. Our Milky Way is part of such a group, the Local Group, which also contains M31 (Andromeda), a second luminous spiral galaxy besides the Milky Way, as well as some far less luminous galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds. Some groups of galaxies are very compact (i.e., their galaxies are confined within a very small volume). Interactions between these galaxies cause the lifetimes of many such groups to be much smaller than the age of the Universe, and the galaxies in such groups will merge.

{\noindent}One of the most important discoveries of the UHURU X-ray satellite, launched in 1970, was the detection of X-ray radiation from massive clusters of galaxies. With the later Einstein X-ray satellite and more recently ROSAT, X-ray emission was also detected from lower-mass clusters and groups. Clusters of galaxies are the brightest extragalactic X-ray sources besides AGNs. If an X-ray telescope is pointed away from the Galactic disk, about 85\% of the detected sources are AGNs, the remaining 15\% are clusters. In contrast to AGNs, for which the X-ray emission is essentially point-like, the X-ray emission of clusters is extended. Their characteristic luminosity is $L_X\sim10^{43}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ up to $10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ for the most massive systems. The fact that this X-ray emission is spatially extended implies that it does not originate from individual galaxies. The spatial region from which we can detect this radiation can have a size of $1\,{\rm Mpc}$ or even larger. In accordance with the extended nature of the X-ray source, no variability of its X-ray flux has been detected.

{\noindent}The assumption that the X-ray emission originates from a hot, diffuse gas (the ICM) was confirmed by the discovery of line emission in the X-ray spectrum of clusters. One of the most prominent lines in massive clusters is located at energies just below $7\,{\rm keV}$: it is the Lyman-$\alpha$ (``K$\alpha$'') line of 25-fold ionized iron (thus, of an iron nucleus with only a single electron). Slightly less ionized iron has a strong transition at somewhat lower energies of $E\sim6.4\,{\rm keV}$. Later, other lines were also discovered in the X-ray spectrum of clusters. As a rule, the hotter the gas is, thus the more completely ionized it is, the weaker the line emission. 

{\noindent}The spectral energy distribution of the X-rays leads to the conclusion that the emission process is optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation) from a hot gas which is collisionally ionized. This radiation is produced by the acceleration of electrons in the Coulomb field of protons and atomic nuclei. Since an accelerated electrically charged particle emits radiation, such scattering processes between electrons and protons in an ionized gas yields emission of photons. From the spectral properties of this radiation, the gas temperature in galaxy clusters can be determined, which is, for clusters with mass between $\sim3\times10^{13}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and $10^{15}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, in the range of $10^7\,{\rm K}$ to $10^8\,{\rm K}$, or $1$ to $10\,{\rm keV}$, respectively.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}Typically, regular clusters have an X-ray luminosity $L_X$ and temperature that smoothly increases with cluster mass. In contrast, irregular clusters at a given mass can be either hotter or cooler than regular clusters. Irregular clusters are the result of a recent merging event, and their temperature depends on the stage of the merging process. In the initial phases of the merger, the kinetic energy is not yet thermalized, and thus the gas remains at approximately the same temperature it had before the merging event. Later on, the gas is heated by shock fronts in which the kinetic energy is transformed into internal energy of the gas (i.e., heat). In this phase, the gas temperature can be higher than that of a regular cluster of the same mass. Finally, the cluster settles into an equilibrium state. Indications of past merger events can be seen in substructures of the X-ray emitting gas; even for the Coma cluster, which is frequently considered a typical example of a relaxed cluster, signs of previous merger events can be detected.

{\noindent}The trend emerges that in clusters with a larger fraction of spiral galaxies, $L_X$ and $T$ are lower. Irregular clusters typically also have a lower central density of galaxies and gas compared to regular clusters. Clusters of galaxies with a dominant central galaxy often show a strong central peak in X-ray emission. The X-ray emission often deviates from axial symmetry, so that the assumption of clusters being roughly spherically symmetric is not well founded in these cases.

\subsection{Question 14}

What is star formation quenching? What is the evidence for it, and why is it thought to happen?

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Star formation quenching can either refer to the termination of SF activity or the process of maintaining a galaxy quiescent despite the presence of fresh fuel and inflows. Although feedback processes are often employed in theoretical studies, quenching does not necessarily mean feedback (i.e., there are quenching mechanisms that are not feedback mechanisms). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain SF quenching, including but not limited to: `cosmological starvation', virial shock heating, AGN feedback, RAM pressure from satellite galaxies, stellar feedback, low SF efficiency, turbulence injection via AGN and magnetic fields, and cold gas being rapidly consumed.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

The term `quenching' has been used with two different meanings in the literature, to indicate either the termination of the star formation activity, or the process of maintaining a galaxy quiescent over its lifetime, despite the fresh fuel produced by stellar evolution and gas inflows. Given the substantially different timescales involved in the two processes, it remains under debate whether one single mechanism is responsible for both the onset and the maintenance of quenching. Archaeological evidence shows that the termination process must be particularly rapid for the most massive galaxies that would become present-day giant ellipticals, most of which were already quenched by a redshift of $z\approx2$. In theoretical studies, feedback by energetic sources is often used to quench star formation. Although closely related, quenching and feedback are not strictly equivalent: there are theoretical scenarios in which galaxies are quenched by processes that are not feedback mechanisms.

{\noindent}Over the years, numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the quenching of massive galaxies, including feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), stellar feedback and gravitational effects. Given that these processes encompass several branches of astrophysics, it is not surprising that studies on the topic have suffered from inconsistent definitions and confusion in the literature.

{\noindent}Normally, stars form out of molecular gas of temperature $T<10^2\,{\rm K}$ that cooled and settled from warm and hot gas within the halo ($T=10^3-10^6\,{\rm K}$) previously accreted from cosmological filaments. Galaxy quenching can be understood as an interruption to any one of the necessary conditions for star formation, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:quenching}. Several of these processes may be in place simultaneously; it is the timescale that determines their relative importance. Following the illustration in Figure \ref{fig:quenching}, we identify five broad classes of quenching mechanisms.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/extragalactic/quenching.png}
    \caption{\footnotesize{Schematic diagram listing the plausible quenching mechanisms. Image taken from Man \& Belli (2018).}}
    \label{fig:quenching}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gas does not accrete. Massive galaxies may quench because of reduced gas accretion onto their dark matter haloes. This condition has been termed cosmological starvation, and it stands as an example of quenching not driven by feedback. Even if accretion is completely shut of, the gas produced by stellar evolution could still fuel subsequent star formation. Therefore, an additional mechanism may be needed to maintain the galaxy quiescent.
    \item Gas does not cool. In the standard picture of galaxy formation, gas collapses in a dark matter halo and heats up because of virial shocks. Simulations show, however, that the shocks are formed only when the halo is more massive than about $10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. This mass scale is roughly the same as the scale above which galaxies are observed to be prevalently quiescent, suggesting that virial shock heating may account for the onset of star formation quenching. After the shock, however, the hot halo gas should cool and become available for star formation. To prevent further star formation, additional gas heating is necessary. The most accepted explanation is feedback from radiatively inefficient accretion onto SMBHs (radio-mode feedback), which is only effective in massive haloes with hot gas. Implementations of this feedback yielded the first successful mass-function predictions from semi-analytical models. In addition to BH accretion, other gas heating mechanisms have been proposed. For example, a gas clump or a satellite falling into a massive halo releases potential energy. If this energy can be efficiently used to heat the halo gas through ram pressure or dynamical friction, this could constitute a substantial source of gravitational heating. Evolved stellar populations may also contribute to the gas heating through stellar feedback from type Ia supernovae and from stars on the asymptotic giant branch. Regardless of the energy source, it is likely that only massive haloes, in which the gas is roughly at the virial temperature, can be kept hot efficiently. Heating processes are essential to solve a related problem. In galaxy clusters, the cooling time is short enough that the gas should quickly flow to the centre and trigger intense star formation; but central galaxies are typically quiescent. This ``cooling flow'' problem is fundamentally similar to galaxy quenching but takes place on larger scales.
    \item Cold gas does not form stars efficiently. Quenching may be due to a low star formation efficiency, rather than the absence of fuel. To form stars, cold gas must dissipate its kinetic energy (bulk motions and turbulence). Certain non-thermal processes may be capable of injecting considerable amounts of kinetic energy, such that the dissipation timescale is too long for the gas to settle. The stellar bulge could provide large-scale shear to inject turbulence, thereby stabilizing the gas disk from fragmentation. This process is called morphological quenching (or sometimes `gravitational quenching'), typically acts on timescales longer than a billion years and is only effective at low molecular gas fractions, below about 10\%. A similar mechanism can be caused by the stellar bar. This bar quenching may act on even shorter timescales if the stellar bar forms rapidly. Other potential sources of turbulence injection are low-power AGNs and magnetic fields. Such mechanisms may be responsible for maintaining low star formation rates but are unlikely to be the sole explanation for the abrupt termination of star formation in massive galaxies.
    \item Cold gas is rapidly consumed. If star formation consumes cold gas faster than it is replenished, the galaxy will run out of fuel and become quiescent. This can happen if star formation takes place in efficient bursts, potentially triggered by compressive gas motions and effective angular momentum loss. Major mergers of galaxies have first been invoked as a possible trigger, and more recently violent disk instabilities and positive AGN feedback have also been suggested. Clearly, gas consumption alone can quench star formation only temporarily. Additional mechanisms are required to maintain low star formation rates until the present day.
    \item Gas is removed. The accretion onto SMBHs could release sufficient energy and momentum to expel gas from galaxies. This quasar-mode feedback is most efficiently triggered by major mergers owing to high gas inflow rates. Although rare and short-lived, this process can quench star formation by removing the gas supply from massive galaxies.
\end{itemize}

{\noindent}Observational limitations have also motivated a number of phenomenological classifications proposed in the literature. The most common one is the distinction between mass quenching, which affects massive galaxies, and environmental quenching, which only acts on satellite galaxies and is omitted from the present discussion. Some studies instead use the term halo quenching to indicate a mechanism that relates to the halo mass rather than stellar mass. Another common division is that between internal and external quenching, but this division is ambiguously defined. Other studies distinguish between a slow quenching (also called strangulation or starvation), when some leftover cold gas is still available after the quenching event, and a fast quenching, which indicates an abrupt end of the star formation activity.

{\noindent}Semi-analytical models and, more recently, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are capable of reproducing the basic properties of quiescent galaxies, such as number counts and colours. In all cases, this is made possible by some form of feedback, generally attributed to AGNs, that heats up the gas only in haloes above a mass threshold. Although this broad agreement is certainly encouraging, the fact that substantially different feedback implementations yield relatively similar galaxy populations is worrying, suggesting that they might have limited power in constraining the physical mechanisms in place. AGN feedback could affect galaxy star formation through different physical processes, and observational studies continue to challenge the validity of the crude feedback recipes applied in cosmological simulations. The intricate connection between galaxies and AGN is crucial to understand quenching. Observationally, the level of suppression of star formation seems to correlate not only with stellar mass, but even more strongly with the surface mass density and central velocity dispersion. However, because galaxy properties are interrelated in a complex way, it is not straightforward to establish causal connections given the observed correlations.

{\noindent} These challenging observations are particularly needed at high redshift, soon after the termination of star formation in massive galaxies. A pressing question is to determine whether recently quenched galaxies possess a significant amount of cold gas. If true, this would challenge the common assumption that galaxies stop forming stars because of a lack of gas, and it would require explanations for the suppression of star formation efficiency. Another priority is to measure the properties of the hot gas in quiescent galaxies. If shock heating is prevalent in massive halos as predicted, one should expect to detect its signature in the circumgalactic medium. Spatially resolved observations could further constrain the origin of gas heating and shocks. Lastly, more detailed observations of gas outflows are needed to determine the importance of ejective processes. Outflows are known to be multi-phase, but it remains debated which phase carries the most mass, and whether most of the gas can escape the deep potential well of massive galaxies.

{\noindent}The essential observation that has driven progress on this subject is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:sfquenching}. It shows that the ratio of stellar mass to total mass reaches a maximum at $V_\mathrm{circ}\sim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ or at $M_{DM}\sim10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. This maximum is $\sim1/5$ of the cosmological baryon fraction, so most baryons in the Universe have not yet made stars. Lower-mass halos have smaller stellar fractions (left panel) and smaller baryon fractions (right panel) because (we believe) the baryons have increasingly been ejected from DM halos by star-formation and supernova feedback or never accreted after cosmological reionization. But the focus here is on higher DM masses. They, too, have smaller stellar mass fractions than at the ``sweet spot'' halo mass of $10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. But Figure \ref{fig:sfquenching} (right) shows that these baryons are not ``missing'' at $M_{DM}\gg10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. On the contrary, the total baryon fraction converges to essentially the cosmological value in the highest-mass halos, which are halos of rich clusters of galaxies. This is the by-now well known result that, as $M_{DM}$ grows above $10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and $V_\mathrm{circ}$ grows above $300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, an increasingly large fraction of the baryons are indeed present but have not made stars. Rather, they are suspended in hot, X-ray-emitting gas, until in rich clusters of galaxies, that hot gas outmasses the stellar galaxies in the cluster by $1.0\pm0.3\,{\rm dex}$. This has led to the essential idea of ``$M_\mathrm{crit}$ quenching'' of star formation by X-ray-emitting gas, which can happen provided that the DM mass is larger than the critical mass, $M_{DM}\gtrsim M_\mathrm{crit}\simeq10^{12}\,{\rm M_\odot}$, that is required to support the formation and retention of hot gas halos.

\end{figure}

{\noindent}The transition mass between galaxies that should contain X-ray gas and those that should not is consistently derived by a variety of theoretical arguments and is consistency checked via a variety of observational tests. It should occur at the DM mass at which the hot gas cooling time is comparable to the infall time. It has been shown from SPH simulations that gas that is accreted during hierarchical clustering falls gently into shallow potential wells and makes star-forming disks, whereas gas crashes violently onto giant galaxies and is shock-heated to the virial temperature. It is this hot gas that quenches star formation. Calculated hot-gas cooling times are short; this led to the well known ``cooling flow problem'' (Fabian 1994). But X-ray measurements of temperature profiles now show that they are much shallower than cooling-time calculations predict in the absence of heating. Debate continues about how the gas is kept hot; it has been suggested that the required heating is caused by continued accretion; AGN feedback is another candidate, and dying stars returning gas to the IGM at just the right kinetic temperature. The engineering details need to be sorted out. It is likely that all processes are important. The important point is that the galaxies and clusters tell us that they know how to keep the gas hot.

{\noindent}Hydrodynamical simulations of disk formation show that SF in the gas disks is far too efficient, consuming the available gas in too short a time, so that most of the stars would be formed at high redshift, with little current star formation left. Furthermore, the resulting disks are too concentrated and too small, leading to rotation curves which are declining outwards beyond the (small) half-light radius of the disk, in marked contrast with observed rotation curves. This together is known as the overcooling problem in galaxy evolution. Real disk galaxies have a slower conversion of gas into stars and their disks remain larger. And finally, the efficient conversion of gas into stars in our simple model would predict that the stellar mass density in the Universe is much higher than observed -- whereas $\omega_b\sim0.04$, the density parameter in stars is less than 1\%. Hence, most baryons in the Universe have not been converted to stars.

{\noindent}Since stars form out of gas, and the gas distribution is much more extended than the stellar distribution, stars can only form at places in the disk where the gas mass density exceeds a certain value. Marteen Schmidt discovered in 1959 a relation between the surface mass density of gas, $\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$ (measured in units of ${\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$) and the star-formation rate per unit area, $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ (measured in units of ${\rm M_\odot\,year^{-1}\,pc^{-2}}$), of the form

\begin{align*}
    \Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} \propto \Sigma_\mathrm{gas}^\alpha ~ [{\rm M_\odot\,year^{-1}\,pc^{-2}}]
\end{align*}

{\noindent}with a power-law index of $\alpha\approx1.4$. The connection between the two quantities was later examined in detail by Rob Kennicutt, and the relation is known as Schmidt-Kennicutt law; including the normalization, one finds

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}}{{\rm M_\odot\,year^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}} = (2.5\pm0.7)\times10^{-4} \left(\frac{\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}}{{\rm M_\odot\,pc^{-2}}}\right)^{1.4\pm0.15}.

{\noindent}Figure \ref{fig:sfhistory} shows the cosmic SF history from UV and IR as well as the best fitting function

\end{align*}

{\noindent}These state-of-the-art surveys provide a remarkably consistent picture of the cosmic SF history: a rising phase, scaling as $\psi(z)\propto(1+z)^{-2.9}$ at $3\lesssim z\lesssim8$, slowing and peaking at some point probably between $z=2$ and $z=1.5$, when the Universe was $\sim3.5\,{\rm Gyr}$ old, followed by a gradual decline to the present day, roughly as $\psi(z)\propto(1+z)^{2.7}$. The increase in $\psi(z)$ from $z\sim8$ to $z\sim3$ appears to have been steady, with no sharp drop at the highest redshifts, although there is now active debate in the literature about whether that trend continues or breaks at redshifts $9$ and beyond. Although a fitting function was adopted that is a double power-law in $(1+z)$, the SFRD data at $z<1$ can also be fit quite well by an exponential decline with cosmic time and an e-folding timescale of $3.9\,{\rm Gyr}$.

    \item At what redshift was the SF rate the highest?
    \item How does this relate to the population of stars we see today (i.e., how old the Sun is, which stars are most common etc.)?

\subsection{Question 15}

Provide three examples of ways in which feedback processes are important on galactic and intergalactic scales.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feedback by supernovae}. Very shortly after star formation sets in, the most massive stars of the stellar population undergo a core-collapse supernova which heats the gas and reduces its star formation efficiency.
    \item \textbf{AGN feedback}. In the case of galaxy clusters, the AGN can insert hot bubbles into the ICM through radio jets. Additionally, the strong radiation field from the quasar can change the ionization structure of the surrounding gas which in turn affects its cooling curve and therefore its efficiency of star formation.
    \item \textbf{Ram-pressure stripping and strangulation}. As a galaxy orbits a cluster, it moves relative to the hot ICM which creates a pressure force on the ISM of the galaxy which can remove the gas if it is greater than the gravitational force of the galaxy.
    \item \textbf{Cannibalism}. Galaxies in a cluster can can lose angular momentum and sink to the center where they can merge with other galaxies, becoming `cannibalized' by other cluster members.

{\noindent}\textbf{Feedback by supernovae:} In order to balance the efficient gas cooling, heating sources need to be considered. An unavoidable source of heating is the energy injected into the ISM by supernovae. Very shortly after star formation sets in, the most massive stars of the stellar population undergo a core-collapse supernova. The mechanical energy of the explosion is partly transferred to the gas surrounding the exploding star. Thereby the gas is heated, causing it to expand, thus to decrease its density, which in turn reduces its cooling efficiency. Note that this is a feedback process -- the higher the star formation rate, the more energy is injected into the interstellar gas to prevent, or at least delay, further SF. Depending on the efficiency of this feedback, the local gas of the disk may be blown out of the disk into the halo (and produce a hot gas corona outside the disk), or, in particular for low-mass halos, be removed from the halo through outflowing gas.

{\noindent}In fact, there is direct observational evidence of the occurrence of outflows from star-forming galaxies. For example, the spectra of Lyman-break galaxies reveal substantial mass outflows, at a similar rate as their star-formation rate and with velocities of several hundreds of ${\rm km\,s^{-1}}$.

{\noindent}The details of this feedback process are somewhat uncertain -- how much of the supernova energy is converted into heat, and how much is transferred to the ISM in form of bulk kinetic energy, is not well determined. Furthermore, the feedback by supernovae depends on the assumed initial mass function of stars, which yields the fraction of newly formed stars which explode as core-collapse supernova. The flatter the IMF at the high-mass end, the more supernova energy per unit mass of newly formed stars is injected.

{\noindent}Assuming a universal IMF, the energy released by supernovae per unit mass of newly-formed stars is $\eta_\mathrm{SN}E_\mathrm{SN}$, where $\eta_\mathrm{SN}$ denotes the expected number of supernovae per unit mass of formed stars, and $E_\mathrm{SN}$ is the energy released per supernova. If we assume that this energy reheats some of the cold gas back to virial temperature of the halo, the amount of gas that is reheated after formation of a group of stars with mass $\Delta m_*$ is

\begin{align*}
    \Delta m_\mathrm{reheat} \sim \epsilon\frac{\eta_\mathrm{SN}E_\mathrm{SN}}{V_{200}^2}\Delta m_* ~ [{\rm M_\odot}],
\end{align*}

{\noindent}where $\epsilon$ parametrizes the efficiency of the reheating process. The reheated gas may be transferred back to the hot gaseous halo, whereas other models assume that the reheated gas is first ejected from the halo, and only later reincorporated into the hot halo on the dynamical time-scale of the halo. This ejection scenario effectively delays the time at which the reheated gas can cool and becomes available for star formation again.

{\noindent}As can be seen from the above equation, supernova feedback is more efficient at suppressing star formation in low-mass galaxies -- which is due to the fact that the binding energy per unit mass is an increasing function of halo mass. This simply expresses the fact that for low-mass halos it is easier to drive the gas outwards.

{\noindent}\textbf{AGN feedback:} Whereas supernova feedback explains a decreasing conversion of gas into stars with decreasing halo mass, and thus can account for the difference of the slopes between the galaxy luminosity function and the halo mass function at the low mass/luminosity end, it is less efficient for higher-mass halos, due to the larger $V_{200}$. The increase of the cooling time for higher-mass halos by itself cannot account for the abrupt exponential decrease of the galaxy luminosity function beyond $L^*$. One requires another process which delays the cooling of gas in high-mass halos.

{\noindent}For very massive halos, we have already encountered such a process: the suppression of cooling flows in galaxy clusters is due to AGN activity of the central galaxy in the cluster. Since (almost) all massive galaxies contain a supermassive black hole, this kind of feedback may be operational not only in groups and clusters, but actually in individual massive galaxies as well. In particular, there is a great deal of evidence for a relation between nuclear starbursts in galaxies and AGN activity. The gas needed for a starburst in the center of a galaxy is also potential fuel for the central black hole. Again, the details of this process are quite uncertain, but with plausible prescriptions, the cut-off of the luminosity function at $L\gtrsim L^*$ can be successfully modeled.

{\noindent}Feedback by an AGN can occur in several ways. In the case of galaxy clusters, the major effect of the AGN is the insertion of hot bubbles into the intracluster medium (ICM) through radio jets. The AGNs in most central cluster galaxies are not very luminous, and seem to be in the `radio mode' of low accretion rate. Thus, for low accretion rates, the main channel of feedback is the injection of mechanical energy into the surrounding gas. At high accretion rates, in the `quasar mode', the main source of feedback is presumably heating of the gas. Furthermore, the strong radiation field from quasars changes the ionization structure of the surrounding gas, which affects its cooling curve compared and at low temperatures actually leads to radiative heating. These various effects should be included in realistic models of the evolution of galaxies, at least in an approximate way.

{\noindent}\textbf{Ram-pressure stripping and strangulation:} As a galaxy orbits in a cluster, it moves relative to the hot ICM. In the rest frame of a galaxy, the ICM acts like a wind, with the wind speed equal to the orbital velocity of the galaxy. This wind causes a pressure force on the ISM of the galaxy; it is proportional to the density of the ICM and the square of the velocity. If this force is stronger than the gravitational force of the galaxy which hosts the interstellar gas, this gas can be removed from the galaxy. This ram-pressure stripping can thus over time turn a gas-rich disk galaxy into a disk galaxy without gas (i.e., a spiral galaxy into an S0 galaxy). This effect may be the origin of the larger abundance of S0 galaxies in clusters than in the field population. It also provides a natural explanation for the Butcher-Oemler effect, which states that clusters of galaxies at higher redshift contain a larger fraction of blue galaxies. The blue (spiral) galaxies that have existed at higher redshift may have turned into S0 galaxies in the meantime. The fact that the fraction of ellipticals in a cluster remains rather constant as a function of redshift, whereas the abundance of S0 galaxies increases with decreasing $z$, indicates the importance of the latter process as an explanation of the Butcher-Oemler effect.

{\noindent}Gas which is removed from the galaxies is chemically enriched. The metallicity of the ICM is believed to be due to the mixing of this enriched gas with the ICM. Hence, the metals of the ICM have been generated by earlier stellar populations in cluster galaxies. The efficiency of this effect, as well as that of harassment, depends on the orbit of the galaxy. If the orbit comes close to the inner part of the cluster where the gas and galaxy number density are large, all the gas may be removed, whereas otherwise, only the outer, more loosely bound gas is lost. In this case, the galaxy retains its gas in the inner part and may continue to form stars for a while; only when this gas supply is exhausted, it then turns into a red galaxy, since no new gas can be gained from cooling or accretion. This effect is called strangulation.

{\noindent}\textbf{Cannibalism:} The orbit of a galaxy in a cluster is affected by dynamical friction; it loses energy and angular momentum, and so its orbit will shrink in time. The efficiency of this effect again depends on the galaxy orbit; the closer it comes to the inner parts of the cluster, the stronger are the gravitational friction forces. Furthermore, it depends on the galaxy mass, with more massive galaxies being affected more strongly. Depending on the orbital parameters, a cluster galaxy can lose most of its angular momentum in a Hubble time, sink to the center, and there merge with the central galaxy. By this process, the central galaxy becomes more massive, as it `cannibalized' other cluster members. The aforementioned mass dependence may lead to an increase of the mass and luminosity difference between the brightest cluster galaxy and the second-brightest one.

\subsection{Question 1}

What is a stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF)? Sketch it. Give a couple of examples of simple parametric forms used to describe the IMF, such as the Chabrier, Kroupa, or Salpeter functions.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Answer.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Since the observable signatures for star formation are obtained only from massive stars, their formation rate needs to be extrapolated to lower masses to obtain the full SFR by assuming an IMF. Typically, a Salpeter-IMF is chosen between $0.1\,M_\odot\geq M\geq 100\,M_\odot$. However, there are clear indications that the IMF may be flatter for $M\gtrsim1\,M_\odot$ than described by the Salpeter law, and several descriptions for such modified IMFs have been developed over the years, mainly based on observations and interpretation of star-forming regions in our MW or in nearby galaxies. The total stellar mass, obtained by integration over the IMF, is up to a factor of $\sim2$ lower in these modified IMFs than for the Salpeter IMF. Thus, this factor provides a characteristic uncertainty in the determination of the SFR from observations; a similar, though somewhat smaller uncertainty applies to the stellar mass density whose estimation also is mainly based on the more massive stars of a galaxy which dominate the luminosity. Furthermore, the IMF need not be universal, but may in principle vary between different environments, or depend on the metallicity of the gas from which stars are formed. Whereas there has not yet been unambiguous evidence for variations of the IMF, this possibility must always be taken into account.

\subsection{General Notes}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $k_B(300\,\mathrm{K}) \sim \dfrac{1}{40}\,{\rm eV}$
    \item $k_B(11,000\,\mathrm{K}) \sim 1\,{\rm eV}$
    \item $k_B(10^7\,\mathrm{K}) \sim 1\,{\rm keV}$
    \item If a particle scatters with a rate greater than the expansion rate of the Universe, that particle remains in equilibrium.
    \item Multipole moment $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ are the dipole and quadrupole moment, respectively.
    \item The greatest baryon contribution to the density comes not from stars in galaxies, but rather from gas in groups of galaxies; in these groups, $\Omega\sim0.02$.
    \item The ratio of the neutrino temperature $T_\nu$ to the CMB temperature $T_\mathrm{CMB}$ is $\dfrac{T_\nu}{T_\mathrm{CMB}} = \left( \dfrac{4}{11} \right)^{1/3}$.
    \item We expect photons to decouple from matter when the Universe is already well into the matter-dominated era (i.e., not in the radiation-dominated era).
    \item When the Universe was only one second old, the mean-free-path of a photon was about the size of an atom.
    \item Nuclear binding energies are typically in the $\rm{MeV}$ range, which explains why Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurs at temperatures a bit less than $1\,\rm{MeV}$ even though nuclear masses are in the $\rm{GeV}$ range.
    \item The electron-positron energy threshold is $\sim10^{10}~{\rm K}$, above which there exist thermal populations of both electrons and neutrinos to make the reaction $p+e^-\leftrightarrow n+\nu$ go equally well in either direction.
    \item Themodynamically, nucleons with greater binding energies are more energetically favourable.
    \item Simplest way to form helium is via deuterium fusion rather than the improbable coincidence of $2$ protons and $2$ neutrons all arriving at the same place simultaneously to make $^4$He in one go.
    \item Nucleosynthesis starts at about $10^{10}\,{\rm K}$ when the Universe was about $1\,{\rm s}$ old, and effectively ends when it has cooled by a factor of $10$, and is about $100$ times older.
    \item Primordial elemental abundances: $75\%$ H, $25\%$ He, trace Li.
    \item A normal population of states in LTE satisfies $(n_1/g_1)/(n_2/g_2)>1$ via the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation; inverted populations such as masers satisfy $(n_1/g_1)/(n_2/g_2)<1$.
    \item The solid angle subtended by a complete sphere is $4\pi~{\rm sr}$.
    \item Just as the period of a Cepheid tells you its luminosity, the rise and fall time of a type Ia SN tells you its peak luminosity.
    \item The Hubble distance $d_H$ is the distance between the Earth and any astrophysical object receding away from us at the speed of light.
    \item At $z=10^9$, the Jeans mass is $M_J\sim M_\odot$; at $z=10^6$, the Jeans mass is $M_J\sim M_\mathrm{gal}$.
    \item Apparent magnitudes $0<m<6$ are typically visible to the naked eye.
    \item The absolute magnitude of a light source $M$ is defined as the apparent magnitude $m$ that it would have if it were at a luminosity distance of $d_L = 10\,{\rm pc}$.
    \item The apparent magnitude is really nothing more than a logarithmic measure of the flux, and the absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the luminosity.
    \item When space is positively curved, the proper surface area is $A_p(t_0) < 4\pi r^2$, and the photons from distance $r$ are spread over a smaller area than they would be in flat space. When space is negatively curved, $A_p(t_0) > 4\pi r^2$, and photons are spread over a larger area than they would be in flat space.
    \item The Benchmark Model has a deceleration parameter of $q_0\approx−0.55$.
    \item The angular distribution of the CMB temperature reflects the matter inhomogeneities at the redshift of decoupling of radiation and matter.
    \item CMB polarization probes the epoch of last scattering directly as opposed to the temperature fluctuations which may evolve between last scattering and the present. Moreover, different sources of temperature anisotropies (scalar, vector, and tensor) give different patterns in the polarization: both in its intrinsic structure and in its correlation with the temperature fluctuations themselves.
    \item The sound speed in the photon-dominated fluid of the early Universe is given by $c_s\approx c/\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the sound horizon is about a factor of $\sqrt{3}$ smaller than the event horizon at this time.
    \item At recombination, the free electrons recombined with the hydrogen and helium nuclei, after which there are essentially no more free electrons which couple to the photon field. Hence, after recombination the baryon fluid lacks the pressure support of the photons, and the sound speed drops to zero -- the sound waves do no longer propagate, but get frozen in.
    \item Due to the steep slope of the IMF, most of the stellar mass is contained in low-mass stars; however, since the luminosity of main-sequence stars depends strongly on mass, approximately as $L\propto M^3$, most of the luminosity comes from high-mass stars.
    \end{itemize}
