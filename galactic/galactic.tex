\subsection{Question 1}

What is a stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF)? Sketch it. Give a couple of examples of simple parametric forms used to describe the IMF, such as the Chabrier, Kroupa, or Salpeter functions.

\subsubsection{Short answer}

Answer.

\subsubsection{Additional context}

Since the observable signatures for star formation are obtained only from massive stars, their formation rate needs to be extrapolated to lower masses to obtain the full SFR by assuming an IMF. Typically, a Salpeter-IMF is chosen between $0.1\,M_\odot\geq M\geq 100\,M_\odot$. However, there are clear indications that the IMF may be flatter for $M\gtrsim1\,M_\odot$ than described by the Salpeter law, and several descriptions for such modified IMFs have been developed over the years, mainly based on observations and interpretation of star-forming regions in our MW or in nearby galaxies. The total stellar mass, obtained by integration over the IMF, is up to a factor of $\sim2$ lower in these modified IMFs than for the Salpeter IMF. Thus, this factor provides a characteristic uncertainty in the determination of the SFR from observations; a similar, though somewhat smaller uncertainty applies to the stellar mass density whose estimation also is mainly based on the more massive stars of a galaxy which dominate the luminosity. Furthermore, the IMF need not be universal, but may in principle vary between different environments, or depend on the metallicity of the gas from which stars are formed. Whereas there has not yet been unambiguous evidence for variations of the IMF, this possibility must always be taken into account.

\subsubsection{Follow-up Questions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How did Salpeter determine the IMF?
    \item How do you normalize the IMF?
    \item Is the upper or lower limit on mass more important for normalization?
