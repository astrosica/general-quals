# General Qualifying Exam Solutions (2018)
This repository contains my solutions for the 2018 General Qualifying Exam. There are five main sections: (1) Cosmology, (2) Extragalactic Astronomy, (3) Galactic Astronomy, (4) Stars and Stellar Astronomy, and (5) Physics. The document Questions2018.pdf contains the question bank; there is a folder containing solutions for each individual sections 1-5 as well as a complete set of solutions in the folder "complete". I have done my best at providing a "short answer" for a very simple understanding of the problem, in addition to some extra reading under "additional context" for more information with every question. At the end of each section, I have outlined the resources I used (although I did not explicitly reference these throughout my solutions). I have also included an Appendix section for commonly used acronyms, mathematical variables, useful values, equations, and some general notes I made to myself along the way. Here I have also done my best to specify dimensions/units where applicable. These solutions by no means are meant to be the final answer to any of these questions -- rather, they are my attempt at the necessary research and trying to piece together a reasonable solution.
