# General Qualifying Exam Solutions (2018)
This repository contains my solutions for the 2018 General Qualifying Exam. There are five main sections: (1) Cosmology, (2) Extragalactic Astronomy, (3) Galactic Astronomy, (4) Stars and Stellar Astronomy, and (5) Physics. The document Questions2018.pdf contains the question bank while QualsSolutions.pdf contains my solutions. I have done my best at providing a "short answer" for a very simple understanding of the problem, in addition to some extra reading under "additional context" for more information with every question. At the end of each section, I have outlined the resources I used (although I did not explicitly reference these throughout my solutions since, as you can see, they are already long enough). At the end of the document, I have also included sections for commonly used acronyms, mathematical parameters, useful values, useful equations, and some general notes I made to myself along the way. Here I have also done my best to specify dimensions/units where applicable. These solutions by no means are meant to be the final answer to any of these questions -- rather, they are my attempt at the necessary research and trying to piece together a reasonable solution. Since I am human and by no means an expert in any of these fields, there are likely to be errors -- please feel free to contact me with corrections and I will try to keep these updated.
